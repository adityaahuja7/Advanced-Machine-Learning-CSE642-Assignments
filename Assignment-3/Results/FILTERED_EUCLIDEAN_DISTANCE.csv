Advanced machine learning (ML) models, such as vision models, can now locally analyze user images to extract insights that drive several functionalities. Capitalizing on this new processing model of locally analyzing user images, we analyze two popular social media apps, TikTok and Instagram, to reveal (1) what insights vision models in both apps infer about users from their image and video data and (2) whether these models exhibit performance disparities with respect to demographics. As vision models provide signals for sensitive technologies like age verification and facial recognition, understanding potential biases in these models is crucial for ensuring that users receive equitable and accurate services.   We develop a novel method for capturing and evaluating ML tasks in mobile apps, overcoming challenges like code obfuscation, native code execution, and scalability. Our method comprises ML task detection, ML pipeline reconstruction, and ML performance assessment, specifically focusing on demographic disparities. We apply our methodology to TikTok and Instagram, revealing significant insights. For TikTok, we find issues in age and gender prediction accuracy, particularly for minors and Black individuals. In Instagram, our analysis uncovers demographic disparities in the extraction of over 500 visual concepts from images, with evidence of spurious correlations between demographic features and certain concepts.",01-Apr-2024
4,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19800v1,Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction,"arXiv:2403.19800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.",01-Apr-2024
14,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19888v1,MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection,"arXiv:2403.19888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.",01-Apr-2024
37,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19710v1,STRUM-LLM: Attributed and Structured Contrastive Summarization,"arXiv:2403.19710v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Users often struggle with decision-making between two options (A vs B), as it usually requires time-consuming research across multiple web pages. We propose STRUM-LLM that addresses this challenge by generating attributed, structured, and helpful contrastive summaries that highlight key differences between the two options. STRUM-LLM identifies helpful contrast: the specific attributes along which the two options differ significantly and which are most likely to influence the user's decision. Our technique is domain-agnostic, and does not require any human-labeled data or fixed attribute list as supervision. STRUM-LLM attributes all extractions back to the input sources along with textual evidence, and it does not have a limit on the length of input sources that it can process. STRUM-LLM Distilled has 100x more throughput than the models with comparable performance while being 10x smaller. In this paper, we provide extensive evaluations for our method and lay out future directions for our currently deployed system.",01-Apr-2024
41,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19725v1,MUGC: Machine Generated versus User Generated Content Detection,"arXiv:2403.19725v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: As advanced modern systems like deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI continue to enhance their capabilities in producing convincing and realistic content, the need to distinguish between user-generated and machine generated content is becoming increasingly evident. In this research, we undertake a comparative evaluation of eight traditional machine-learning algorithms to distinguish between machine-generated and human-generated data across three diverse datasets: Poems, Abstracts, and Essays. Our results indicate that traditional methods demonstrate a high level of accuracy in identifying machine-generated data, reflecting the documented effectiveness of popular pre-trained models like RoBERT. We note that machine-generated texts tend to be shorter and exhibit less word variety compared to human-generated content. While specific domain-related keywords commonly utilized by humans, albeit disregarded by current LLMs (Large Language Models), may contribute to this high detection accuracy, we show that deeper word representations like word2vec can capture subtle semantic variances. Furthermore, readability, bias, moral, and affect comparisons reveal a discernible contrast between machine-generated and human generated content. There are variations in expression styles and potentially underlying biases in the data sources (human and machine-generated). This study provides valuable insights into the advancing capacities and challenges associated with machine-generated content across various domains.",01-Apr-2024
45,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19776v1,CLoRA: A Contrastive Approach to Compose Multiple LoRA Models,"arXiv:2403.19776v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) have emerged as a powerful and popular technique in the field of image generation, offering a highly effective way to adapt and refine pre-trained deep learning models for specific tasks without the need for comprehensive retraining. By employing pre-trained LoRA models, such as those representing a specific cat and a particular dog, the objective is to generate an image that faithfully embodies both animals as defined by the LoRAs. However, the task of seamlessly blending multiple concept LoRAs to capture a variety of concepts in one image proves to be a significant challenge. Common approaches often fall short, primarily because the attention mechanisms within different LoRA models overlap, leading to scenarios where one concept may be completely ignored (e.g., omitting the dog) or where concepts are incorrectly combined (e.g., producing an image of two cats instead of one cat and one dog). To overcome these issues, CLoRA addresses them by updating the attention maps of multiple LoRA models and leveraging them to create semantic masks that facilitate the fusion of latent representations. Our method enables the creation of composite images that truly reflect the characteristics of each LoRA, successfully merging multiple concepts or styles. Our comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methodologies, marking a significant advancement in the field of image generation with LoRAs. Furthermore, we share our source code, benchmark dataset, and trained LoRA models to promote further research on this topic.",01-Apr-2024
47,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19783v1,AlloyBERT: Alloy Property Prediction with Large Language Models,"arXiv:2403.19783v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The pursuit of novel alloys tailored to specific requirements poses significant challenges for researchers in the field. This underscores the importance of developing predictive techniques for essential physical properties of alloys based on their chemical composition and processing parameters. This study introduces AlloyBERT, a transformer encoder-based model designed to predict properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength of alloys using textual inputs. Leveraging the pre-trained RoBERTa encoder model as its foundation, AlloyBERT employs self-attention mechanisms to establish meaningful relationships between words, enabling it to interpret human-readable input and predict target alloy properties. By combining a tokenizer trained on our textual data and a RoBERTa encoder pre-trained and fine-tuned for this specific task, we achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.00015 on the Multi Principal Elemental Alloys (MPEA) data set and 0.00611 on the Refractory Alloy Yield Strength (RAYS) dataset. This surpasses the performance of shallow models, which achieved a best-case MSE of 0.00025 and 0.0076 on the MPEA and RAYS datasets respectively. Our results highlight the potential of language models in material science and establish a foundational framework for text-based prediction of alloy properties that does not rely on complex underlying representations, calculations, or simulations.",01-Apr-2024
49,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19845v1,Generalized Gradient Descent is a Hypergraph Functor,"arXiv:2403.19845v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.",01-Apr-2024
50,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19851v1,Localizing Paragraph Memorization in Language Models,"arXiv:2403.19851v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Can we localize the weights and mechanisms used by a language model to memorize and recite entire paragraphs of its training data? In this paper, we show that while memorization is spread across multiple layers and model components, gradients of memorized paragraphs have a distinguishable spatial pattern, being larger in lower model layers than gradients of non-memorized examples. Moreover, the memorized examples can be unlearned by fine-tuning only the high-gradient weights. We localize a low-layer attention head that appears to be especially involved in paragraph memorization. This head is predominantly focusing its attention on distinctive, rare tokens that are least frequent in a corpus-level unigram distribution. Next, we study how localized memorization is across the tokens in the prefix by perturbing tokens and measuring the caused change in the decoding. A few distinctive tokens early in a prefix can often corrupt the entire continuation. Overall, memorized continuations are not only harder to unlearn, but also to corrupt than non-memorized ones.",01-Apr-2024
57,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19913v1,MANGO: A Benchmark for Evaluating Mapping and Navigation Abilities of Large Language Models,"arXiv:2403.19913v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Large language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently achieved astonishing performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose MANGO, a benchmark to evaluate their capabilities to perform text-based mapping and navigation. Our benchmark includes 53 mazes taken from a suite of textgames: each maze is paired with a walkthrough that visits every location but does not cover all possible paths. The task is question-answering: for each maze, a large language model reads the walkthrough and answers hundreds of mapping and navigation questions such as ""How should you go to Attic from West of House?"" and ""Where are we if we go north and east from Cellar?"". Although these questions are easy to humans, it turns out that even GPT-4, the best-to-date language model, performs poorly at answering them. Further, our experiments suggest that a strong mapping and navigation ability would benefit large language models in performing relevant downstream tasks, such as playing textgames. Our MANGO benchmark will facilitate future research on methods that improve the mapping and navigation capabilities of language models. We host our leaderboard, data, code, and evaluation program at https://mango.ttic.edu and https://github.com/oaklight/mango/.",01-Apr-2024
60,oai:arXiv.org:2403.19962v1,Enhancing the General Agent Capabilities of Low-Parameter LLMs through Tuning and Multi-Branch Reasoning,"arXiv:2403.19962v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong language understanding and generation capabilities, making them highly successful in a variety of tasks. However, when used as agents for dealing with complex problems in the real world, their performance is far inferior to large commercial models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. As intelligent agents, LLMs need to have the capabilities of task planning, long-term memory, and the ability to leverage external tools to achieve satisfactory performance. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the agent capabilities of LLMs. On the one hand, methods involve constructing agent-specific data and fine-tuning the models. On the other hand, some methods focus on designing prompts that effectively activate the reasoning abilities of the LLMs. We explore both strategies on the 7B and 13B models. We propose a comprehensive method for constructing agent-specific data using GPT-4. Through supervised fine-tuning with constructed data, we find that for these models with a relatively small number of parameters, supervised fine-tuning can significantly reduce hallucination outputs and formatting errors in agent tasks. Furthermore, techniques such as multi-path reasoning and task decomposition can effectively decrease problem complexity and enhance the performance of LLMs as agents. We evaluate our method on five agent tasks of AgentBench and achieve satisfactory results.",01-Apr-2024
77,oai:arXiv.org:2403.20190v1,Homomorphic WiSARDs: Efficient Weightless Neural Network training over encrypted data,"arXiv:2403.20190v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The widespread application of machine learning algorithms is a matter of increasing concern for the data privacy research community, and many have sought to develop privacy-preserving techniques for it. Among existing approaches, the homomorphic evaluation of ML algorithms stands out by performing operations directly over encrypted data, enabling strong guarantees of confidentiality. The homomorphic evaluation of inference algorithms is practical even for relatively deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). However, training is still a major challenge, with current solutions often resorting to lightweight algorithms that can be unfit for solving more complex problems, such as image recognition. This work introduces the homomorphic evaluation of Wilkie, Stonham, and Aleksander's Recognition Device (WiSARD) and subsequent Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) for training and inference on encrypted data. Compared to CNNs, WNNs offer better performance with a relatively small accuracy drop. We develop a complete framework for it, including several building blocks that can be of independent interest. Our framework achieves 91.7% accuracy on the MNIST dataset after only 3.5 minutes of encrypted training (multi-threaded), going up to 93.8% in 3.5 hours. For the HAM10000 dataset, we achieve 67.9% accuracy in just 1.5 minutes, going up to 69.9% after 1 hour. Compared to the state of the art on the HE evaluation of CNN training, Glyph (Lou et al., NeurIPS 2020), these results represent a speedup of up to 1200 times with an accuracy loss of at most 5.4%. For HAM10000, we even achieved a 0.65% accuracy improvement while being 60 times faster than Glyph. We also provide solutions for small-scale encrypted training. In a single thread on a desktop machine using less than 200MB of memory, we train over 1000 MNIST images in 12 minutes or over the entire Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset in just 11 seconds.",01-Apr-2024
90,oai:arXiv.org:2403.20284v1,LayerNorm: A key component in parameter-efficient fine-tuning,"arXiv:2403.20284v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), has been proven to be an effective method for solving many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to the large number of parameters in many state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, the process of fine-tuning is computationally expensive. One attractive solution to this issue is parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which involves modifying only a minimal segment of the model while keeping the remainder unchanged. Yet, it remains unclear which segment of the BERT model is crucial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we first analyze different components in the BERT model to pinpoint which one undergoes the most significant changes after fine-tuning. We find that output LayerNorm changes more than any other components when fine-tuned for different General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) tasks. Then we show that only fine-tuning the LayerNorm can reach comparable, or in some cases better, performance to full fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Moreover, we use Fisher information to determine the most critical subset of LayerNorm and demonstrate that many NLP tasks in the GLUE benchmark can be solved by fine-tuning only a small portion of LayerNorm with negligible performance degradation.",01-Apr-2024
97,oai:arXiv.org:2112.02856v4,Doubly Optimal No-Regret Online Learning in Strongly Monotone Games with Bandit Feedback,"arXiv:2112.02856v4 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: We consider online no-regret learning in unknown games with bandit feedback, where each player can only observe its reward at each time -- determined by all players' current joint action -- rather than its gradient. We focus on the class of \textit{smooth and strongly monotone} games and study optimal no-regret learning therein. Leveraging self-concordant barrier functions, we first construct a new bandit learning algorithm and show that it achieves the single-agent optimal regret of $\tilde{\Theta}(n\sqrt{T})$ under smooth and strongly concave reward functions ($n \geq 1$ is the problem dimension). We then show that if each player applies this no-regret learning algorithm in strongly monotone games, the joint action converges in the \textit{last iterate} to the unique Nash equilibrium at a rate of $\tilde{\Theta}(nT^{-1/2})$. Prior to our work, the best-known convergence rate in the same class of games is $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3}T^{-1/3})$ (achieved by a different algorithm), thus leaving open the problem of optimal no-regret learning algorithms (since the known lower bound is $\Omega(nT^{-1/2})$). Our results thus settle this open problem and contribute to the broad landscape of bandit game-theoretical learning by identifying the first doubly optimal bandit learning algorithm, in that it achieves (up to log factors) both optimal regret in the single-agent learning and optimal last-iterate convergence rate in the multi-agent learning. We also present preliminary numerical results on several application problems to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in terms of iteration count.",01-Apr-2024
106,oai:arXiv.org:2304.12420v2,Sample-Efficient and Surrogate-Based Design Optimization of Underwater Vehicle Hulls,"arXiv:2304.12420v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Physics simulations like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are a computational bottleneck in computer-aided design (CAD) optimization processes. To overcome this bottleneck, one requires either an optimization framework that is highly sample-efficient, or a fast data-driven proxy (surrogate model) for long-running simulations. Both approaches have benefits and limitations. Bayesian optimization is often used for sample efficiency, but it solves one specific problem and struggles with transferability; alternatively, surrogate models can offer fast and often more generalizable solutions for CFD problems, but gathering data for and training such models can be computationally demanding. In this work, we leverage recent advances in optimization and artificial intelligence (AI) to explore both of these potential approaches, in the context of designing an optimal unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) hull. Our study finds that the Bayesian Optimization-Lower Condition Bound (BO-LCB) algorithm is the most sample-efficient optimization framework and has the best convergence behavior of those considered. Subsequently, we show that our DNN-based surrogate model predicts drag force on test data in tight agreement with CFD simulations, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.85%. Combining these results, we demonstrate a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup (with comparable accuracy) for the design optimization process when the surrogate model is used. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying Bayesian optimization and DNN-based surrogate modeling to the problem of UUV design optimization, and we share our developments as open-source software.",01-Apr-2024
122,oai:arXiv.org:2403.08585v2,Improving Implicit Regularization of SGD with Preconditioning for Least Square Problems,"arXiv:2403.08585v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits strong algorithmic regularization effects in practice and plays an important role in the generalization of modern machine learning. However, prior research has revealed instances where the generalization performance of SGD is worse than ridge regression due to uneven optimization along different dimensions. Preconditioning offers a natural solution to this issue by rebalancing optimization across different directions. Yet, the extent to which preconditioning can enhance the generalization performance of SGD and whether it can bridge the existing gap with ridge regression remains uncertain. In this paper, we study the generalization performance of SGD with preconditioning for the least squared problem. We make a comprehensive comparison between preconditioned SGD and (standard \& preconditioned) ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding and improving SGD with preconditioning. First, we establish excess risk bounds (generalization performance) for preconditioned SGD and ridge regression under an arbitrary preconditions matrix. Second, leveraging the excessive risk characterization of preconditioned SGD and ridge regression, we show that (through construction) there exists a simple preconditioned matrix that can outperform (standard \& preconditioned) ridge regression. Finally, we show that our proposed preconditioning matrix is straightforward enough to allow robust estimation from finite samples while maintaining a theoretical advantage over ridge regression. Our empirical results align with our theoretical findings, collectively showcasing the enhanced regularization effect of preconditioned SGD.",01-Apr-2024

We pose and formalize the problem of optimized selection of the validation set used in LRW training, to improve classifier generalization. In particular, we show that using hard-to-classify instances in the validation set has both a theoretical connection to, and strong empirical evidence of generalization. We provide an efficient algorithm for training this meta-optimized model, as well as a simple train-twice heuristic for careful comparative study. We demonstrate that LRW with easy validation data performs consistently worse than LRW with hard validation data, establishing the validity of our meta-optimization problem. Our proposed algorithm outperforms a wide range of baselines on a range of datasets and domain shift challenges (Imagenet-1K, CIFAR-100, Clothing-1M, CAMELYON, WILDS, etc.), with ~1% gains using VIT-B on Imagenet. We also show that using naturally hard examples for validation (Imagenet-R / Imagenet-A) in LRW training for Imagenet improves performance on both clean and naturally hard test instances by 1-2%. Secondary analyses show that using hard validation data in an LRW framework improves margins on test data, hinting at the mechanism underlying our empirical gains. We believe this work opens up new research directions for the meta-optimization of meta-learning in a supervised learning context.",01-Apr-2024

However, the reliance on extensive multicenter datasets for training AI models poses challenges due to privacy concerns. Federated learning provides a solution by facilitating collaborative model training across multiple centers without sharing raw data. This study introduces a federated attention-consistent learning (FACL) framework to address challenges associated with large-scale pathological images and data heterogeneity. FACL enhances model generalization by maximizing attention consistency between local clients and the server model. To ensure privacy and validate robustness, we incorporated differential privacy by introducing noise during parameter transfer. We assessed the effectiveness of FACL in cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading tasks using 19,461 whole-slide images of prostate cancer from multiple centers. In the diagnosis task, FACL achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9718, outperforming seven centers with an average AUC of 0.9499 when categories are relatively balanced. For the Gleason grading task, FACL attained a Kappa score of 0.8463, surpassing the average Kappa score of 0.7379 from six centers. In conclusion, FACL offers a robust, accurate, and cost-effective AI training model for prostate cancer pathology while maintaining effective data safeguards.",01-Apr-2024

In this study, we introduce mPLUG-Owl, a novel training paradigm that equips LLMs with multi-modal abilities through modularized learning of foundation LLM, a visual knowledge module, and a visual abstractor module. This approach can support multiple modalities and facilitate diverse unimodal and multimodal abilities through modality collaboration. The training paradigm of mPLUG-Owl involves a two-stage method for aligning image and text, which learns visual knowledge with the assistance of LLM while maintaining and even improving the generation abilities of LLM. In the first stage, the visual knowledge module and abstractor module are trained with a frozen LLM module to align the image and text. In the second stage, language-only and multi-modal supervised datasets are used to jointly fine-tune a low-rank adaption (LoRA) module on LLM and the abstractor module by freezing the visual knowledge module. We carefully build a visually-related instruction evaluation set OwlEval. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing multi-modal models, demonstrating mPLUG-Owl's impressive instruction and visual understanding ability, multi-turn conversation ability, and knowledge reasoning ability. Besides, we observe some unexpected and exciting abilities such as multi-image correlation and scene text understanding, which makes it possible to leverage it for harder real scenarios, such as vision-only document comprehension.

Despite its utility, it remains computationally intensive, especially for large-scale problems. Recently, a novel Wasserstein distance specifically tailored for Gaussian mixture models and known as MW (mixture Wasserstein) has been introduced by several authors. In scenarios where data exhibit clustering, this approach simplifies to a small-scale discrete optimal transport problem, which complexity depends solely on the number of Gaussian components in the GMMs. This paper aims to extend MW by introducing new Gromov-type distances. These distances are designed to be isometry-invariant in Euclidean spaces and are applicable for comparing GMMs across different dimensional spaces. Our first contribution is the Mixture Gromov Wasserstein distance (MGW), which can be viewed as a Gromovized version of MW. This new distance has a straightforward discrete formulation, making it highly efficient for estimating distances between GMMs in practical applications. To facilitate the derivation of a transport plan between GMMs, we present a second distance, the Embedded Wasserstein distance (EW). This distance turns out to be closely related to several recent alternatives to Gromov-Wasserstein. We show that EW can be adapted to derive a distance as well as optimal transportation plans between GMMs. We demonstrate the efficiency of these newly proposed distances on medium to large-scale problems, including shape matching and hyperspectral image color transfer.",01-Apr-2024

While these finite-time guarantees highlight its merits, OGD has the drawback that it requires knowing the strong convexity/monotonicity parameters. In this paper, we design a fully adaptive OGD algorithm, \textsf{AdaOGD}, that does not require a priori knowledge of these parameters. In the single-agent setting, our algorithm achieves $O(\log^2(T))$ regret under strong convexity, which is optimal up to a log factor. Further, if each agent employs \textsf{AdaOGD} in strongly monotone games, the joint action converges in a last-iterate sense to a unique Nash equilibrium at a rate of $O(\frac{\log^3 T}{T})$, again optimal up to log factors. We illustrate our algorithms in a learning version of the classical newsvendor problem, where due to lost sales, only (noisy) gradient feedback can be observed. Our results immediately yield the first feasible and near-optimal algorithm for both the single-retailer and multi-retailer settings. We also extend our results to the more general setting of exp-concave cost functions and games, using the online Newton step (ONS) algorithm.",01-Apr-2024

In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions, addressing the limitations (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method, GAvatar, enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality, and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution.",01-Apr-2024

We call our simple recipe Inheritune and first demonstrate it for building a small base LM with 1.5B parameters using 1B tokens (and a starting few layers of larger LM of 3B parameters); we do this using a single A6000 GPU for less than half a day. Across 9 diverse evaluation datasets as well as the MMLU benchmark, the resulting model compares favorably to publicly available base models of 1B-2B size, some of which have been trained using 50-1000 times more tokens.   We investigate Inheritune in a slightly different setting where we train small LMs utilizing larger LMs and their full pre-training dataset. Here we show that smaller LMs trained utilizing some of the layers of GPT2-medium (355M) and GPT-2-large (770M) can effectively match the val loss of their bigger counterparts when trained from scratch for the same number of training steps on OpenWebText dataset with 9B tokens.

  learning with neural networks","Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.",2024-04-12

  Human Feedback for LLMs","State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks. However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model.

Recent research has started developing quality assurance methods for LLMs, introducing techniques such as offline detector-based or uncertainty estimation methods. However, these approaches predominantly concentrate on post-generation analysis, leaving the online safety analysis for LLMs during the generation phase an unexplored area. To bridge this gap, we conduct in this work a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of existing online safety analysis methods on LLMs. We begin with a pilot study that validates the feasibility of detecting unsafe outputs in the early generation process. Following this, we establish the first publicly available benchmark of online safety analysis for LLMs, including a broad spectrum of methods, models, tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing this benchmark, we extensively analyze the performance of state-of-the-art online safety analysis methods on both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods and offers valuable insights into selecting the most appropriate method based on specific application scenarios and task requirements. Furthermore, we also explore the potential of using hybridization methods, i.e., combining multiple methods to derive a collective safety conclusion, to enhance the efficacy of online safety analysis for LLMs. Our findings indicate a promising direction for the development of innovative and trustworthy quality assurance methodologies for LLMs, facilitating their reliable deployments across diverse domains.",2024-04-12

Despite DAC's empirical success, the original AIL objective is on-policy and DAC's ad-hoc application of off-policy training does not guarantee successful imitation (Kostrikov et al., 2019; 2020). Follow-up work such as ValueDICE (Kostrikov et al., 2020) tackles this issue by deriving a fully off-policy AIL objective. Instead in this work, we develop a novel and principled AIL algorithm via the framework of boosting. Like boosting, our new algorithm, AILBoost, maintains an ensemble of properly weighted weak learners (i.e., policies) and trains a discriminator that witnesses the maximum discrepancy between the distributions of the ensemble and the expert policy. We maintain a weighted replay buffer to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble, allowing us to train discriminators using the entire data collected so far. In the weighted replay buffer, the contribution of the data from older policies are properly discounted with the weight computed based on the boosting framework. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on both controller state-based and pixel-based environments from the DeepMind Control Suite. AILBoost outperforms DAC on both types of environments, demonstrating the benefit of properly weighting replay buffer data for off-policy training.

This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate.

We sidestep these challenges and introduce a simple and lightweight approach to adjust pretrained model predictions via optimal transport. Our technique requires only an estimate of the label distribution of a downstream task. Theoretically, we characterize the improvement produced by our procedure under certain mild conditions and provide bounds on the error caused by misspecification.

We study and criticise this assumption, highlighting how it can hinder optimisation and prevent uncertainty quantification. We prove that loss functions bias conditionally independent neural networks to become overconfident in their predictions. As a result, they are unable to represent uncertainty over multiple valid options. Furthermore, we prove that these loss functions are difficult to optimise: they are non-convex, and their minima are usually highly disconnected.

Current approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks, such as the state-of-the-art CTGAN model, struggle with the complex structures inherent in tabular data.

  Subnetworks","Multi-modal learning aims to enhance performance by unifying models from various modalities but often faces the ""modality imbalance"" problem in real data, leading to a bias towards dominant modalities and neglecting others, thereby limiting its overall effectiveness. To address this challenge, the core idea is to balance the optimization of each modality to achieve a joint optimum. Existing approaches often employ a modal-level control mechanism for adjusting the update of each modal parameter. However, such a global-wise updating mechanism ignores the different importance of each parameter. Inspired by subnetwork optimization, we explore a uniform sampling-based optimization strategy and find it more effective than global-wise updating. According to the findings, we further propose a novel importance sampling-based, element-wise joint optimization method, called Adaptively Mask Subnetworks Considering Modal Significance(AMSS). Specifically, we incorporate mutual information rates to determine the modal significance and employ non-uniform adaptive sampling to select foreground subnetworks from each modality for parameter updates, thereby rebalancing multi-modal learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the reliability of the AMSS strategy through convergence analysis. Building upon theoretical insights, we further enhance the multi-modal mask subnetwork strategy using unbiased estimation, referred to as AMSS+.

In this paper, we investigate tokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of transformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn from certain simple $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k > 1$, transformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization, they empirically fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters according to a unigram model (Makkuva et al., 2024). With the addition of tokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through this barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from the source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this observation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss achieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate tokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens) learnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn from $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally.

The standard method of feeding images to transformer encoders is to divide the images into patches and then feed the patches to the model as a linear sequence of tokens. For high-resolution images, e.g. microscopic pathology images, the quadratic compute and memory cost prohibits the use of an attention-based model, if we are to use smaller patch sizes that are favorable in segmentation. The solution is to either use custom complex multi-resolution models or approximate attention schemes. We take inspiration from Adapative Mesh Refinement (AMR) methods in HPC by adaptively patching the images, as a pre-processing step, based on the image details to reduce the number of patches being fed to the model, by orders of magnitude.

  Reducing Computational Efforts via Tucker Decomposition","We address the computational barrier of deploying advanced deep learning segmentation models in clinical settings by studying the efficacy of network compression through tensor decomposition. We propose a post-training Tucker factorization that enables the decomposition of pre-existing models to reduce computational requirements without impeding segmentation accuracy. We applied Tucker decomposition to the convolutional kernels of the TotalSegmentator (TS) model, an nnU-Net model trained on a comprehensive dataset for automatic segmentation of 117 anatomical structures. Our approach reduced the floating-point operations (FLOPs) and memory required during inference, offering an adjustable trade-off between computational efficiency and segmentation quality. This study utilized the publicly available TS dataset, employing various downsampling factors to explore the relationship between model size, inference speed, and segmentation performance. The application of Tucker decomposition to the TS model substantially reduced the model parameters and FLOPs across various compression rates, with limited loss in segmentation accuracy. We removed up to 88% of the model's parameters with no significant performance changes in the majority of classes after fine-tuning. Practical benefits varied across different graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures, with more distinct speed-ups on less powerful hardware. Post-hoc network compression via Tucker decomposition presents a viable strategy for reducing the computational demand of medical image segmentation models without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This approach enables the broader adoption of advanced deep learning technologies in clinical practice, offering a way to navigate the constraints of hardware capabilities.",2024-04-15

Fairness of such models is one such aspect that is deservedly gaining more attention. In this work, we analyse the natural language representations of documents and sentences (i.e., encodings) for any embedding-level bias that could potentially also affect the fairness of the downstream tasks that rely on them. We identify bias in these encodings either towards or against different sub-groups based on the difference in their reconstruction errors along various subsets of principal components.

Researchers continuously invent various tricks to address this shortcoming. For instance, in the fundamental Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) technique of Language Model alignment, in addition to reward maximization, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the trainable policy and the SFT policy is minimized. This addition prevents the model from being overfitted to the Reward Model (RM) and generating texts that are out-of-domain for the RM. The Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method reformulates the optimization task of RLHF and eliminates the Reward Model while tacitly maintaining the requirement for the policy to be close to the SFT policy. In our paper, we argue that this implicit limitation in the DPO method leads to sub-optimal results. We propose a new method called Trust Region DPO (TR-DPO), which updates the reference policy during training. With such a straightforward update, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TR-DPO against DPO on the Anthropic HH and TLDR datasets. We show that TR-DPO outperforms DPO by up to 19%, measured by automatic evaluation with GPT-4. The new alignment approach that we propose allows us to improve the quality of models across several parameters at once, such as coherence, correctness, level of detail, helpfulness, and harmlessness.",2024-04-15

However, current simulation-based amortized inference methods are simulation-hungry and inflexible: They require the specification of a fixed parametric prior, simulator, and inference tasks ahead of time. Here, we present a new amortized inference method -- the Simformer -- which overcomes these limitations. By training a probabilistic diffusion model with transformer architectures, the Simformer outperforms current state-of-the-art amortized inference approaches on benchmark tasks and is substantially more flexible: It can be applied to models with function-valued parameters, it can handle inference scenarios with missing or unstructured data, and it can sample arbitrary conditionals of the joint distribution of parameters and data, including both posterior and likelihood.

VLAP transforms the embedding space of pretrained vision models into the LLMs' word embedding space using a single linear layer for efficient and general-purpose visual and language understanding. Specifically, we harness well-established word embeddings to bridge two modality embedding spaces. The visual and text representations are simultaneously assigned to a set of word embeddings within pretrained LLMs by formulating the assigning procedure as an optimal transport problem. We predict the assignment of one modality from the representation of another modality data, enforcing consistent assignments for paired multimodal data. This allows vision and language representations to contain the same information, grounding the frozen LLMs' word embedding space in visual data. Moreover, a robust semantic taxonomy of LLMs can be preserved with visual data since the LLMs interpret and reason linguistic information from correlations between word embeddings. Experimental results show that VLAP achieves substantial improvements over the previous linear transformation-based approaches across a range of vision-language tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. We also demonstrate the learned visual representations hold a semantic taxonomy of LLMs, making visual semantic arithmetic possible.",2024-04-15

In this domain, the imperative role of representative datasets is a cornerstone in shaping the trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) development. Representative datasets are needed to train machine learning components properly. Proper training has multiple impacts: it reduces the final model's complexity, power, and uncertainties. In this paper, we investigate the reliability of the $\varepsilon$-representativeness method to assess the dataset similarity from a theoretical perspective for decision trees. We decided to focus on the family of decision trees because it includes a wide variety of models known to be explainable. Thus, in this paper, we provide a result guaranteeing that if two datasets are related by $\varepsilon$-representativeness, i.e., both of them have points closer than $\varepsilon$, then the predictions by the classic decision tree are similar.

We introduce Shatter, a novel DL approach in which nodes create virtual nodes (VNs) to disseminate chunks of their full model on their behalf. This enhances privacy by (i) preventing attackers from collecting full models from other nodes, and (ii) hiding the identity of the original node that produced a given model chunk. We theoretically prove the convergence of Shatter and provide a formal analysis demonstrating how Shatter reduces the efficacy of attacks compared to when exchanging full models between participating nodes. We evaluate the convergence and attack resilience of Shatter with existing DL algorithms, with heterogeneous datasets, and against three standard privacy attacks, including gradient inversion. Our evaluation shows that Shatter not only renders these privacy attacks infeasible when each node operates 16 VNs but also exhibits a positive impact on model convergence compared to standard DL.

To address this, advanced deep learning-based LDCT denoising algorithms have been developed, primarily using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformer Networks with the Unet architecture. This architecture enhances image detail by integrating feature maps from the encoder and decoder via skip connections. However, current methods often overlook enhancements to the Unet architecture itself, focusing instead on optimizing encoder and decoder structures. This approach can be problematic due to the significant differences in feature map characteristics between the encoder and decoder, where simple fusion strategies may not effectively reconstruct images.In this paper, we introduce WiTUnet, a novel LDCT image denoising method that utilizes nested, dense skip pathways instead of traditional skip connections to improve feature integration. WiTUnet also incorporates a windowed Transformer structure to process images in smaller, non-overlapping segments, reducing computational load. Additionally, the integration of a Local Image Perception Enhancement (LiPe) module in both the encoder and decoder replaces the standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Transformers, enhancing local feature capture and representation.

  in Large Language Models","During inference for transformer-based large language models (LLM), prefilling is the computation of the key-value (KV) cache for input tokens in the prompt prior to autoregressive generation. For longer input prompt lengths, prefilling will incur a significant overhead on decoding time. In this work, we highlight the following pitfall of prefilling: for batches containing high-varying prompt lengths, significant computation is wasted by the standard practice of padding sequences to the maximum length. As LLMs increasingly support longer context lengths, potentially up to 10 million tokens, variations in prompt lengths within a batch become more pronounced. To address this, we propose Prepacking, a simple yet effective method to optimize prefilling computation. To avoid redundant computation on pad tokens, prepacking combines prompts of varying lengths into a sequence and packs multiple sequences into a compact batch using a bin-packing algorithm. It then modifies the attention mask and positional encoding to compute multiple prefilled KV-caches for multiple prompts within a single sequence. On standard curated dataset containing prompts with varying lengths, we obtain a significant speed and memory efficiency improvements as compared to the default padding-based prefilling computation within Huggingface across a range of base model configurations and inference serving scenarios.",2024-04-15

To address this problem, we propose a new parallelism paradigm, elastic sequence parallelism (ESP), to elastically adapt to the variance between different requests and phases. Based on ESP, we design and build LoongServe, an LLM serving system that (1) improves computation efficiency by elastically adjusting the degree of parallelism in real-time, (2) improves communication efficiency by reducing key-value cache migration overhead and overlapping partial decoding communication with computation, and (3) improves GPU memory efficiency by reducing key-value cache fragmentation across instances.

In contrast to the well-known approach where full 3D scenes of a virtual world are utilized to generate artificial datasets, ANYU was created by incorporating RGB-D representations of virtual reality objects into the original NYU depth v2 images. We specifically did not match each generated virtual object with an appropriate texture and a suitable location within the real-world image. Instead, an assignment of texture, location, lighting, and other rendering parameters was randomized to maximize a diversity of the training data, and to show that it is randomness that can improve the generalizing ability of a dataset. By conducting extensive experiments with our virtually modified dataset and validating on the original NYU depth v2 and iBims-1 benchmarks, we show that ANYU improves the monocular depth estimation performance and generalization of deep neural networks with considerably different architectures, especially for the current state-of-the-art VPD model.

The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. In this paper, we introduce a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision.

We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation.

These two elements are vital to a trustworthy environment for learning systems. While numerous studies have concentrated on protecting individual privacy through differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, emerging research indicates that differential privacy in machine learning models can unequally impact separate demographic subgroups regarding prediction accuracy. This leads to a fairness concern, and manifests as biased performance. Although the prevailing view is that enhancing privacy intensifies fairness disparities, a smaller, yet significant, subset of research suggests the opposite view. In this article, with extensive evaluation results, we demonstrate that the impact of differential privacy on fairness is not monotonous. Instead, we observe that the accuracy disparity initially grows as more DP noise (enhanced privacy) is added to the ML process, but subsequently diminishes at higher privacy levels with even more noise. Moreover, implementing gradient clipping in the differentially private stochastic gradient descent ML method can mitigate the negative impact of DP noise on fairness.

However, basic FLA systems have privacy limitations: they do not necessarily require anonymization mechanisms like differential privacy (DP), and provide limited protections against a potentially malicious service provider. Adding DP to a basic FLA system currently requires either adding excessive noise to each device's updates, or assuming an honest service provider that correctly implements the mechanism and only uses the privatized outputs. Secure multiparty computation (SMPC) -based oblivious aggregations can limit the service provider's access to individual user updates and improve DP tradeoffs, but the tradeoffs are still suboptimal, and they suffer from scalability challenges and susceptibility to Sybil attacks. This paper introduces a novel system architecture that leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) and open-sourcing to both ensure confidentiality of server-side computations and provide externally verifiable privacy properties, bolstering the robustness and trustworthiness of private federated computations.",2024-04-16

However, the practice of placing multiple tenants on shared physical hardware raises security and privacy concerns, most notably side-channel attacks.   In this paper, we investigate the possibility of fingerprinting containers through CPU frequency reporting sensors in Intel and AMD CPUs. One key enabler of our attack is that the current CPU frequency information can be accessed by user-space attackers. We demonstrate that Docker images exhibit a unique frequency signature, enabling the distinction of different containers with up to 84.5% accuracy even when multiple containers are running simultaneously in different cores. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of our attack when performed against several sandboxes deployed in cloud environments, including Google's gVisor, AWS' Firecracker, and TEE-based platforms like Gramine (utilizing Intel SGX) and AMD SEV.

Neural-based end-to-end learnable ISPs offer promising advancements, potentially replacing traditional ISPs with their ability to adapt without requiring extensive tuning for each new camera model, as is often the case for nearly every module in traditional ISPs. However, the key challenge with the recent learning-based ISPs is the urge to collect large paired datasets for each distinct camera model due to the influence of intrinsic camera characteristics on the formation of input raw images. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel method for unpaired learning of raw-to-raw translation across diverse cameras. Specifically, we propose Rawformer, an unsupervised Transformer-based encoder-decoder method for raw-to-raw translation. It accurately maps raw images captured by a certain camera to the target camera, facilitating the generalization of learnable ISPs to new unseen cameras.

  Image Super-resolution","Image super-resolution is a fundamentally ill-posed problem because multiple valid high-resolution images exist for one low-resolution image. Super-resolution methods based on diffusion probabilistic models can deal with the ill-posed nature by learning the distribution of high-resolution images conditioned on low-resolution images, avoiding the problem of blurry images in PSNR-oriented methods. However, existing diffusion-based super-resolution methods have high time consumption with the use of iterative sampling, while the quality and consistency of generated images are less than ideal due to problems like color shifting. In this paper, we propose Efficient Conditional Diffusion Model with Probability Flow Sampling (ECDP) for image super-resolution. To reduce the time consumption, we design a continuous-time conditional diffusion model for image super-resolution, which enables the use of probability flow sampling for efficient generation. Additionally, to improve the consistency of generated images, we propose a hybrid parametrization for the denoiser network, which interpolates between the data-predicting parametrization and the noise-predicting parametrization for different noise scales. Moreover, we design an image quality loss as a complement to the score matching loss of diffusion models, further improving the consistency and quality of super-resolution. Extensive experiments on DIV2K, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate that our method achieves higher super-resolution quality than existing diffusion-based image super-resolution methods while having lower time consumption.

First, we decouple the continual learning policy into a diffusion-based generative behavior model and a multi-head action evaluation model, allowing the policy to inherit distributional expressivity for encompassing a progressive range of diverse behaviors. Second, we train a task-conditioned diffusion model to mimic state distributions of past tasks. Generated states are paired with corresponding responses from the behavior generator to represent old tasks with high-fidelity replayed samples. Finally, by interleaving pseudo samples with real ones of the new task, we continually update the state and behavior generators to model progressively diverse behaviors, and regularize the multi-head critic via behavior cloning to mitigate forgetting.

The growing number of applications leveraging AI/ML had led to a scarcity of the expensive conventional accelerators (such as GPUs), which begs the need for the alternative specialized-accelerators that are scalable and cost-efficient. AWS Trainium is the second-generation machine learning accelerator that has been purposely built for training large deep learning models. Its corresponding instance, Amazon EC2 trn1, is an alternative to GPU instances for LLM training.

In principle, these inductive biases are deeply complementary: they most directly specify properties of the latent space, encoder, and decoder, respectively. In practice, however, naively combining existing techniques instantiating these inductive biases fails to yield significant benefits. To address this, we propose adaptations to the three techniques that simplify the learning problem, equip key regularization terms with stabilizing invariances, and quash degenerate incentives.

Specifically, indirect Ratebook optimization, a widely-used method for new business price setting, relies on predictor models such as XGBoost or GLMs/GAMs to estimate on downstream individually optimized prices. However, this strategy is prone to sequential errors and struggles to effectively manage optimizations for continuous rate scenarios. In practice, to save time actuaries frequently opt for optimization within discrete intervals (e.g., range of [-20\%, +20\%] with fix increments) leading to approximate estimations. Moreover, to circumvent infeasible solutions they often use relaxed constraints leading to suboptimal pricing strategies. The reverse-engineered nature of traditional models complicates the enforcement of fairness and can lead to biased outcomes. Our method addresses these challenges by employing a direct optimization strategy in the continuous space of rates and by embedding fairness through an adversarial predictor model. This innovation not only reduces sequential errors and simplifies the complexities found in traditional models but also directly integrates fairness measures into the commercial premium calculation. We demonstrate improved margin performance and stronger enforcement of fairness highlighting the critical need to evolve existing pricing strategies.",2024-04-16

  Mixture Models and Optimal Transport","In this paper, we tackle Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), a task in transfer learning where one adapts multiple heterogeneous, labeled source probability measures towards a different, unlabeled target measure. We propose a novel framework for MSDA, based on Optimal Transport (OT) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our framework has two key advantages. First, OT between GMMs can be solved efficiently via linear programming. Second, it provides a convenient model for supervised learning, especially classification, as components in the GMM can be associated with existing classes. Based on the GMM-OT problem, we propose a novel technique for calculating barycenters of GMMs. Based on this novel algorithm, we propose two new strategies for MSDA: GMM-WBT and GMM-DaDiL. We empirically evaluate our proposed methods on four benchmarks in image classification and fault diagnosis, showing that we improve over the prior art while being faster and involving fewer parameters.",2024-04-16

  Networks","The high volume and rapid evolution of content on social media present major challenges for studying the stance of social media users. In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Experiments demonstrate that our user-hashtag heuristic and the semi-supervised GNN method outperform zero-shot stance labeling using LLMs such as GPT4.

Our analysis has two folds, one based on designing neural architectures and training them from scratch, and another based on large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Our research questions are: 1) Can we effectively augment models by explicit supervised retrieval of the relevant KB information to solve the KB-VQA problem? 2) How do task-specific and LLM-based models perform in the integration of visual and external knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning over both sources of information? 3) Is the implicit knowledge of LLMs sufficient for KB-VQA and to what extent it can replace the explicit KB? Our results demonstrate the positive impact of empowering task-specific and LLM models with supervised external and visual knowledge retrieval models. Our findings show that though LLMs are stronger in 1-hop reasoning, they suffer in 2-hop reasoning in comparison with our fine-tuned NN model even if the relevant information from both modalities is available to the model. Moreover, we observed that LLM models outperform the NN model for KB-related questions which confirms the effectiveness of implicit knowledge in LLMs however, they do not alleviate the need for external KB.",2024-04-16

A prevalent method for analyzing adversarial examples is through a frequency-based approach. However, existing research indicates that attacks designed to exploit low-frequency or high-frequency information can enhance attack performance, leading to an unclear relationship between adversarial perturbations and different frequency components. In this paper, we seek to demystify this relationship by exploring the characteristics of adversarial perturbations within the frequency domain. We employ wavelet packet decomposition for detailed frequency analysis of adversarial examples and conduct statistical examinations across various frequency bands. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that significant adversarial perturbations are present within the high-frequency components of low-frequency bands. Drawing on this insight, we propose a black-box adversarial attack algorithm based on combining different frequency bands. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that combining low-frequency bands and high-frequency components of low-frequency bands can significantly enhance attack efficiency. The average attack success rate reaches 99\%, surpassing attacks that utilize a single frequency segment. Additionally, we introduce the normalized disturbance visibility index as a solution to the limitations of $L_2$ norm in assessing continuous and discrete perturbations.",2024-04-16

Given an assignment $\mathbf{x}$ to all variables in $\mathbf{X}$ (evidence) and a real number $q$, the constrained most-probable explanation (CMPE) task seeks to find an assignment $\mathbf{y}$ to all variables in $\mathbf{Y}$ such that $f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ is maximized and $g(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\leq q$. In our proposed self-supervised approach, given assignments $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{X}$ (data), we train a deep neural network that learns to output near-optimal solutions to the CMPE problem without requiring access to any pre-computed solutions.

  Understanding","The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality. However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express ""peace"", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.",2024-04-17

Previous works focus either on learning a LTL task-satisfying policy alone or are restricted to finite state spaces. We make two contributions: First, we introduce an RL-friendly approach to this setting by formulating this problem as a single optimization objective. Our formulation guarantees that an optimal policy will be reward-maximal from the set of policies that maximize the likelihood of satisfying the LTL specification. Second, we address a sparsity issue that often arises for LTL-guided Deep RL policies by introducing Cycle Experience Replay (CyclER), a technique that automatically guides RL agents towards the satisfaction of an LTL specification.

In this work, we focus on membership inference attack (MIA) based evaluation, one of the most common approaches for evaluating unlearning algorithms, and address various pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics that lack reliability. Specifically, we propose a game-theoretic framework that formalizes the evaluation process as a game between unlearning algorithms and MIA adversaries, measuring the data removal efficacy of unlearning algorithms by the capability of the MIA adversaries. Through careful design of the game, we demonstrate that the natural evaluation metric induced from the game enjoys provable guarantees that the existing evaluation metrics fail to satisfy.

Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets, resulting in a 30.25% improvement when scaling to 1 billion parameters and 28.98% improvement when increasing size of dataset to eightfold.

By conducting extensive experiments, we show that GenFighter outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in accuracy under attack and attack success rate metrics.

We focus on a special case of this task, component attribution, where the goal is to estimate the counterfactual impact of individual components on a given prediction. We then present COAR, a scalable algorithm for estimating component attributions; we demonstrate its effectiveness across models, datasets, and modalities.

This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these approaches and investigates the benefits of restricting to policy structures that are well-established by decades of inventory theory. In particular, we prove generalization guarantees for learning several well-known classes of inventory policies, including base-stock and (s, S) policies, by leveraging the celebrated Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory. We apply the concepts of the Pseudo-dimension and Fat-shattering dimension from VC theory to determine the generalizability of inventory policies, that is, the difference between an inventory policy's performance on training data and its expected performance on unseen data. We focus on a classical setting without contexts, but allow for an arbitrary distribution over demand sequences and do not make any assumptions such as independence over time. We corroborate our supervised learning results using numerical simulations.   Managerially, our theory and simulations translate to the following insights. First, there is a principle of ""learning less is more"" in inventory management: depending on the amount of data available, it may be beneficial to restrict oneself to a simpler, albeit suboptimal, class of inventory policies to minimize overfitting errors. Second, the number of parameters in a policy class may not be the correct measure of overfitting error: in fact, the class of policies defined by T time-varying base-stock levels exhibits a generalization error comparable to that of the two-parameter (s, S) policy class. Finally, our research suggests situations in which it could be beneficial to incorporate the concepts of base-stock and inventory position into black-box learning machines, instead of having these machines directly learn the order quantity actions.",2024-04-17

Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models.

Models trained to detect offensive language on social media are trained and/or fine-tuned using large amounts of data often stored in centralized servers. Since most social media data originates from end users, we propose a privacy preserving decentralized architecture for identifying offensive language online by introducing Federated Learning (FL) in the context of offensive language identification. FL is a decentralized architecture that allows multiple models to be trained locally without the need for data sharing hence preserving users' privacy. We propose a model fusion approach to perform FL. We trained multiple deep learning models on four publicly available English benchmark datasets (AHSD, HASOC, HateXplain, OLID) and evaluated their performance in detail.

  Partitioning","Key Point Analysis (KPA), the summarization of multiple arguments into a concise collection of key points, continues to be a significant and unresolved issue within the field of argument mining. Existing models adapt a two-stage pipeline of clustering arguments or generating key points for argument clusters. This approach rely on semantic similarity instead of measuring the existence of shared key points among arguments. Additionally, it only models the intra-cluster relationship among arguments, disregarding the inter-cluster relationship between arguments that do not share key points. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for KPA with pairwise generation and graph partitioning. Our objective is to train a generative model that can simultaneously provide a score indicating the presence of shared key point between a pair of arguments and generate the shared key point. Subsequently, to map generated redundant key points to a concise set of key points, we proceed to construct an arguments graph by considering the arguments as vertices, the generated key points as edges, and the scores as edge weights. We then propose a graph partitioning algorithm to partition all arguments sharing the same key points to the same subgraph.

  Minimization, and Selective Inference","The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.",2024-04-17

  Memory","Transformer models have been successful in various sequence processing tasks, but the self-attention mechanism's computational cost limits its practicality for long sequences. Although there are existing attention variants that improve computational efficiency, they have a limited ability to abstract global information effectively based on their hand-crafted mixing strategies. On the other hand, state-space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences but cannot capture complicated local information. Therefore, the combination of them as a unified token mixer is a trend in recent long-sequence models. However, the linearized attention degrades performance significantly even when equipped with SSMs. To address the issue, we propose a new method called LongVQ. LongVQ uses the vector quantization (VQ) technique to compress the global abstraction as a length-fixed codebook, enabling the linear-time computation of the attention matrix. This technique effectively maintains dynamic global and local patterns, which helps to complement the lack of long-range dependency issues.

  Language Model","Federated learning aims to tackle the ``isolated data island"" problem, where it trains a collective model from physically isolated clients while safeguarding the privacy of users' data. However, supervised federated learning necessitates that each client labels their data for training, which can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive, and may even be impractical for edge devices. Moreover, the training and transmission of deep models present challenges to the computation and communication capabilities of the clients. To address these two inherent challenges in supervised federated learning, we propose a novel lightweight unsupervised federated learning approach that leverages unlabeled data on each client to perform lightweight model training and communication by harnessing pretrained vision-language models, such as CLIP. By capitalizing on the zero-shot prediction capability and the well-trained image encoder of the pre-trained CLIP model, we have carefully crafted an efficient and resilient self-training approach. This method refines the initial zero-shot predicted pseudo-labels of unlabeled instances through the sole training of a linear classifier on top of the fixed image encoder. Additionally, to address data heterogeneity within each client, we propose a class-balanced text feature sampling strategy for generating synthetic instances in the feature space to support local training.

  Disentanglement","Content moderation faces a challenging task as social media's ability to spread hate speech contrasts with its role in promoting global connectivity. With rapidly evolving slang and hate speech, the adaptability of conventional deep learning to the fluid landscape of online dialogue remains limited. In response, causality inspired disentanglement has shown promise by segregating platform specific peculiarities from universal hate indicators. However, its dependency on available ground truth target labels for discerning these nuances faces practical hurdles with the incessant evolution of platforms and the mutable nature of hate speech. Using confidence based reweighting and contrastive regularization, this study presents HATE WATCH, a novel framework of weakly supervised causal disentanglement that circumvents the need for explicit target labeling and effectively disentangles input features into invariant representations of hate. Empirical validation across platforms two with target labels and two without positions HATE WATCH as a novel method in cross platform hate speech detection with superior performance.

Such graphs are essential for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for handling this graph-structured data. Although gradient descent is commonly utilized for training GNNs for node classification, this study ventures into alternative methods, eliminating the iterative optimization processes. We introduce TrainlessGNN, a linear GNN model capitalizing on the observation that text encodings from the same class often cluster together in a linear subspace. This model constructs a weight matrix to represent each class's node attribute subspace, offering an efficient approach to semi-supervised node classification on TAG.

Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples -- the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated examples. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL. Reinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human examples. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases and can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs. Our analysis also reveals the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance.",2024-04-17

FedAvg has become a foundational parameter update strategy for federated learning, which has been promising to eliminate the effect of the heterogeneous data across clients and guarantee convergence. However, the synchronization parameter update barriers for each communication round during the training significant time on waiting, slowing down the training procedure. Therefore, recent state-of-the-art solutions propose using semi-asynchronous approaches to mitigate the waiting time cost with guaranteed convergence. Nevertheless, emerging semi-asynchronous approaches are unable to eliminate the waiting time completely.   We propose a full asynchronous training paradigm, called FedFa, which can guarantee model convergence and eliminate the waiting time completely for federated learning by using a few buffered results on the server for parameter updating. Further, we provide theoretical proof of the convergence rate for our proposed FedFa. Extensive experimental results indicate our approach effectively improves the training performance of federated learning by up to 6x and 4x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art synchronous and semi-asynchronous strategies while retaining high accuracy in both IID and Non-IID scenarios.",2024-04-17

Most existing methods for finding a control function $u^*$ require learning of a new control function if the training set is updated. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of $\textit{tuning without forgetting}$. We develop $\textit{an iterative algorithm}$ to tune the control function $u^*$ when the training set expands, whereby points already in the paired set are still matched, and new training samples are learned. More specifically, at each update of our method, the control $u^*$ is projected onto the kernel of the end-point mapping generated by the controlled dynamics at the learned samples. It ensures keeping the end points for the previously learned samples constant while iteratively learning additional samples.

Graph continual learning (GCL) tackles this problem by continually adapting GNNs to the expanded graph of the current task while maintaining the performance over the graph of previous tasks. Memory replay-based methods, which aim to replay data of previous tasks when learning new tasks, have been explored as one principled approach to mitigate the forgetting of the knowledge learned from the previous tasks. In this paper we extend this methodology with a novel framework, called Debiased Lossless Memory replay (DeLoMe). Unlike existing methods that sample nodes/edges of previous graphs to construct the memory, DeLoMe learns small lossless synthetic node representations as the memory. The learned memory can not only preserve the graph data privacy but also capture the holistic graph information, for which the sampling-based methods are not viable. Further, prior methods suffer from bias toward the current task due to the data imbalance between the classes in the memory data and the current data. A debiased GCL loss function is devised in DeLoMe to effectively alleviate this bias.

  Uncertainty","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to perform well on exclusive, multi-class classification tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hyper-Evidential Neural Network (HENN) that explicitly models predictive uncertainty due to composite class labels in training data in the context of the belief theory called Subjective Logic (SL). By placing a grouped Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural network as parameters of hyper-subjective opinions and learn the network that collects both single and composite evidence leading to these hyper-opinions by a deterministic DNN from data. We introduce a new uncertainty type called vagueness originally designed for hyper-opinions in SL to quantify composite classification uncertainty for DNNs.

To overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach to infer the Group-Aware Coordination Graph (GACG), which is designed to capture both the cooperation between agent pairs based on current observations and group-level dependencies from behaviour patterns observed across trajectories. This graph is further used in graph convolution for information exchange between agents during decision-making. To further ensure behavioural consistency among agents within the same group, we introduce a group distance loss, which promotes group cohesion and encourages specialization between groups.

Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples are kept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that is the label owner. Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels. These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL. In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.

This is especially important when the auxiliary dataset is large. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks, improving the existing state-of-the-art FPR95 by 4% on our ImageNet experiment.

Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors.

In response to the complex nature of the classical RLHF pipeline, direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as an alternative approach. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup, there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploys reinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a single arm. In this work we rectify this difference, first we theoretically show that we can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results, we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because of its token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of credit assignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classical search-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to the language generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPO policy. Empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningful improvement over the base DPO policy. Finally, we show how the choice of reference policy causes implicit rewards to decline during training.

To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier.

Our method is based on the principle that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of that feature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is ""removed"" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that corresponds to that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the feature dimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, as estimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model's performance changes on the modified test data set, with the target feature dimension removed.

As an initial step, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating a functional equation defined by conditional expectations via adversarial estimation, where the objective function is quadratic in the functional space. For this problem, we establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1} ) $ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$ denotes the time and $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural network. In terms of representation learning, our results show that the feature representation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from the initial one by the magnitude of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})$, measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance.

Use of RAG for combined understanding of multimodal data such as text, images and videos is appealing but two critical limitations exist: one-time, upfront capture of all content in large multimodal data as text descriptions entails high processing times, and not all information in the rich multimodal data is typically in the text descriptions. Since the user queries are not known apriori, developing a system for multimodal to text conversion and interactive querying of multimodal data is challenging.   To address these limitations, we propose iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable interactive querying of large corpus of multimodal data. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG quickly indexes large repositories of multimodal data, and in the incremental workflow, it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select portions of the multimodal data to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long multimodal to text conversion times, overcomes information loss issues by doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in multimodal data, and ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive querying of large, real-world multimodal data. Experimental results on real-world long videos demonstrate 23x to 25x faster video to text ingestion, while ensuring that quality of responses to interactive user queries is comparable to responses from a traditional RAG where all video data is converted to text upfront before any querying.",2024-04-18

Their probabilistic behavior enables certain ranking qualities that are impossible with deterministic models.

A core difficulty in LTR is gradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have been limited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks). This is in stark contrast with the general field of LTR where Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) have long been considered the state-of-the-art.   In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first stochastic LTR method for GBDTs. Our main contribution is a novel estimator for the second-order derivatives, i.e., the Hessian matrix, which is a requirement for effective GBDTs. To efficiently compute both the first and second-order derivatives simultaneously, we incorporate our estimator into the existing PL-Rank framework, which was originally designed for first-order derivatives only. Our experimental results indicate that stochastic LTR without the Hessian has extremely poor performance, whilst the performance is competitive with the current state-of-the-art with our estimated Hessian.

Experiments highlight zkUCB's superior performance, attributing its enhanced reward to judicious quantization bit usage that reduces information entropy in the decision-making process. zkUCB's proof size and verification time scale linearly with the execution steps of zkUCB. This showcases zkUCB's adept balance between data security and operational efficiency.

  Adaptation of Neural Predictive Models","In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.",2024-04-18

While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension.

520,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11949v1,Sketch-guided Image Inpainting with Partial Discrete Diffusion Process,"In this work, we study the task of sketch-guided image inpainting. Unlike the well-explored natural language-guided image inpainting, which excels in capturing semantic details, the relatively less-studied sketch-guided inpainting offers greater user control in specifying the object's shape and pose to be inpainted. As one of the early solutions to this task, we introduce a novel partial discrete diffusion process (PDDP). The forward pass of the PDDP corrupts the masked regions of the image and the backward pass reconstructs these masked regions conditioned on hand-drawn sketches using our proposed sketch-guided bi-directional transformer. The proposed novel transformer module accepts two inputs -- the image containing the masked region to be inpainted and the query sketch to model the reverse diffusion process. This strategy effectively addresses the domain gap between sketches and natural images, thereby, enhancing the quality of inpainting results. In the absence of a large-scale dataset specific to this task, we synthesize a dataset from the MS-COCO to train and extensively evaluate our proposed framework against various competent approaches in the literature. The qualitative and quantitative results and user studies establish that the proposed method inpaints realistic objects that fit the context in terms of the visual appearance of the provided sketch.

  Task-Agnostic Insights","Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have emerged as powerful generative models, known for delivering remarkable results under constrained computational resources. However, deploying LDMs on resource-limited devices remains a complex issue, presenting challenges such as memory consumption and inference speed. To address this issue, we introduce LD-Pruner, a novel performance-preserving structured pruning method for compressing LDMs. Traditional pruning methods for deep neural networks are not tailored to the unique characteristics of LDMs, such as the high computational cost of training and the absence of a fast, straightforward and task-agnostic method for evaluating model performance. Our method tackles these challenges by leveraging the latent space during the pruning process, enabling us to effectively quantify the impact of pruning on model performance, independently of the task at hand. This targeted pruning of components with minimal impact on the output allows for faster convergence during training, as the model has less information to re-learn, thereby addressing the high computational cost of training. Consequently, our approach achieves a compressed model that offers improved inference speed and reduced parameter count, while maintaining minimal performance degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three different tasks: text-to-image (T2I) generation, Unconditional Image Generation (UIG) and Unconditional Audio Generation (UAG). Notably, we reduce the inference time of Stable Diffusion (SD) by 34.9% while simultaneously improving its FID by 5.2% on MS-COCO T2I benchmark.

  Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model: Pairwise Likelihood Ratios, Prior Knowledge, and
  Path Enumeration","Effective causal discovery is essential for learning the causal graph from observational data. The linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) operates under the assumption of a linear data generating process with non-Gaussian noise in determining the causal graph. Its assumption of unmeasured confounders being absent, however, poses practical limitations. In response, empirical research has shown that the reformulation of LiNGAM as a shortest path problem (LiNGAM-SPP) addresses this limitation. Within LiNGAM-SPP, mutual information is chosen to serve as the measure of independence. A challenge is introduced - parameter tuning is now needed due to its reliance on kNN mutual information estimators. The paper proposes a threefold enhancement to the LiNGAM-SPP framework.   First, the need for parameter tuning is eliminated by using the pairwise likelihood ratio in lieu of kNN-based mutual information. This substitution is validated on a general data generating process and benchmark real-world data sets, outperforming existing methods especially when given a larger set of features. The incorporation of prior knowledge is then enabled by a node-skipping strategy implemented on the graph representation of all causal orderings to eliminate violations based on the provided input of relative orderings. Flexibility relative to existing approaches is achieved. Last among the three enhancements is the utilization of the distribution of paths in the graph representation of all causal orderings. From this, crucial properties of the true causal graph such as the presence of unmeasured confounders and sparsity may be inferred. To some extent, the expected performance of the causal discovery algorithm may be predicted. The refinements above advance the practicality and performance of LiNGAM-SPP, showcasing the potential of graph-search-based methodologies in advancing causal discovery.",2024-04-18

  Hierarchical Speculative Decoding","With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable to long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

However, the trial-and-error nature of RL and the inherent randomness associated with solution approximations cause variations in the learned optimal values and policies. This has significantly hindered their successful deployment in real life applications where control responses need to meet dynamic performance criteria deterministically. Here we propose a novel phased actor in actor-critic (PAAC) method, aiming at improving policy gradient estimation and thus the quality of the control policy. Specifically, PAAC accounts for both $Q$ value and TD error in its actor update. We prove qualitative properties of PAAC for learning convergence of the value and policy, solution optimality, and stability of system dynamics. Additionally, we show variance reduction in policy gradient estimation. PAAC performance is systematically and quantitatively evaluated in this study using DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Results show that PAAC leads to significant performance improvement measured by total cost, learning variance, robustness, learning speed and success rate. As PAAC can be piggybacked onto general policy gradient learning frameworks, we select well-known methods such as direct heuristic dynamic programming (dHDP), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and their variants to demonstrate the effectiveness of PAAC.

Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples are kept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that is the label owner. Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels. These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL. In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.

However, these methods fail to fully exploit the local information embedded in the auxiliary dataset.   In this work, we propose the idea of leveraging the information embedded in the gradient of the loss function during training to enable the network to not only learn a desired OOD score for each sample but also to exhibit similar behavior in a local neighborhood around each sample.   We also develop a novel energy-based sampling method to allow the network to be exposed to more informative OOD samples during the training phase.

Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors.

In response to the complex nature of the classical RLHF pipeline, direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as an alternative approach. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup, there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploys reinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a single arm. In this work we rectify this difference, first we theoretically show that we can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results, we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because of its token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of credit assignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classical search-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to the language generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPO policy. Empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningful improvement over the base DPO policy.

Our method is based on the principle that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of that feature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is ""removed"" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that corresponds to that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the feature dimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, as estimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model's performance changes on the modified test data set, with the target feature dimension removed.

In particular, we restrict the functions to the class of overparameterized two-layer neural networks and study (i) the convergence of the gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning of the neural network. As an initial step, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating a functional equation defined by conditional expectations via adversarial estimation, where the objective function is quadratic in the functional space. For this problem, we establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1} ) $ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex.

Use of RAG for combined understanding of multimodal data such as text, images and videos is appealing but two critical limitations exist: one-time, upfront capture of all content in large multimodal data as text descriptions entails high processing times, and not all information in the rich multimodal data is typically in the text descriptions. Since the user queries are not known apriori, developing a system for multimodal to text conversion and interactive querying of multimodal data is challenging.   To address these limitations, we propose iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable interactive querying of large corpus of multimodal data. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG quickly indexes large repositories of multimodal data, and in the incremental workflow, it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select portions of the multimodal data to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long multimodal to text conversion times, overcomes information loss issues by doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in multimodal data, and ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive querying of large, real-world multimodal data. Experimental results on real-world long videos demonstrate 23x to 25x faster video to text ingestion, while ensuring that quality of responses to interactive user queries is comparable to responses from a traditional RAG where all video data is converted to text upfront before any querying.",2024-04-18

We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a k-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions.

Multiple channels, such as speech (voice) and facial expressions (image), are crucial in understanding human emotions. However, AI's journey in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is marked by substantial technical challenges. One significant hurdle is how AI models manage the absence of a particular modality - a frequent occurrence in real-world situations.

  Learning to Rank with Gradient Boosted Trees","Stochastic learning to rank (LTR) is a recent branch in the LTR field that concerns the optimization of probabilistic ranking models. Their probabilistic behavior enables certain ranking qualities that are impossible with deterministic models. For example, they can increase the diversity of displayed documents, increase fairness of exposure over documents, and better balance exploitation and exploration through randomization. A core difficulty in LTR is gradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have been limited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks). This is in stark contrast with the general field of LTR where Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) have long been considered the state-of-the-art.   In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first stochastic LTR method for GBDTs. Our main contribution is a novel estimator for the second-order derivatives, i.e., the Hessian matrix, which is a requirement for effective GBDTs. To efficiently compute both the first and second-order derivatives simultaneously, we incorporate our estimator into the existing PL-Rank framework, which was originally designed for first-order derivatives only. Our experimental results indicate that stochastic LTR without the Hessian has extremely poor performance, whilst the performance is competitive with the current state-of-the-art with our estimated Hessian. Thus, through the contribution of our novel Hessian estimation method, we have successfully introduced GBDTs to stochastic LTR.",2024-04-18

  Adaptation of Neural Predictive Models","In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.",2024-04-18

While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension.

596,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11949v1,Sketch-guided Image Inpainting with Partial Discrete Diffusion Process,"In this work, we study the task of sketch-guided image inpainting. Unlike the well-explored natural language-guided image inpainting, which excels in capturing semantic details, the relatively less-studied sketch-guided inpainting offers greater user control in specifying the object's shape and pose to be inpainted. As one of the early solutions to this task, we introduce a novel partial discrete diffusion process (PDDP). The forward pass of the PDDP corrupts the masked regions of the image and the backward pass reconstructs these masked regions conditioned on hand-drawn sketches using our proposed sketch-guided bi-directional transformer. The proposed novel transformer module accepts two inputs -- the image containing the masked region to be inpainted and the query sketch to model the reverse diffusion process. This strategy effectively addresses the domain gap between sketches and natural images, thereby, enhancing the quality of inpainting results. In the absence of a large-scale dataset specific to this task, we synthesize a dataset from the MS-COCO to train and extensively evaluate our proposed framework against various competent approaches in the literature.

However, deploying LDMs on resource-limited devices remains a complex issue, presenting challenges such as memory consumption and inference speed. To address this issue, we introduce LD-Pruner, a novel performance-preserving structured pruning method for compressing LDMs. Traditional pruning methods for deep neural networks are not tailored to the unique characteristics of LDMs, such as the high computational cost of training and the absence of a fast, straightforward and task-agnostic method for evaluating model performance. Our method tackles these challenges by leveraging the latent space during the pruning process, enabling us to effectively quantify the impact of pruning on model performance, independently of the task at hand. This targeted pruning of components with minimal impact on the output allows for faster convergence during training, as the model has less information to re-learn, thereby addressing the high computational cost of training. Consequently, our approach achieves a compressed model that offers improved inference speed and reduced parameter count, while maintaining minimal performance degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three different tasks: text-to-image (T2I) generation, Unconditional Image Generation (UIG) and Unconditional Audio Generation (UAG). Notably, we reduce the inference time of Stable Diffusion (SD) by 34.9% while simultaneously improving its FID by 5.2% on MS-COCO T2I benchmark.

  Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model: Pairwise Likelihood Ratios, Prior Knowledge, and
  Path Enumeration","Effective causal discovery is essential for learning the causal graph from observational data. The linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) operates under the assumption of a linear data generating process with non-Gaussian noise in determining the causal graph. Its assumption of unmeasured confounders being absent, however, poses practical limitations. In response, empirical research has shown that the reformulation of LiNGAM as a shortest path problem (LiNGAM-SPP) addresses this limitation. Within LiNGAM-SPP, mutual information is chosen to serve as the measure of independence. A challenge is introduced - parameter tuning is now needed due to its reliance on kNN mutual information estimators. The paper proposes a threefold enhancement to the LiNGAM-SPP framework.   First, the need for parameter tuning is eliminated by using the pairwise likelihood ratio in lieu of kNN-based mutual information. This substitution is validated on a general data generating process and benchmark real-world data sets, outperforming existing methods especially when given a larger set of features. The incorporation of prior knowledge is then enabled by a node-skipping strategy implemented on the graph representation of all causal orderings to eliminate violations based on the provided input of relative orderings. Flexibility relative to existing approaches is achieved. Last among the three enhancements is the utilization of the distribution of paths in the graph representation of all causal orderings. From this, crucial properties of the true causal graph such as the presence of unmeasured confounders and sparsity may be inferred. To some extent, the expected performance of the causal discovery algorithm may be predicted. The refinements above advance the practicality and performance of LiNGAM-SPP, showcasing the potential of graph-search-based methodologies in advancing causal discovery.",2024-04-18

However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable to long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts.

However, the trial-and-error nature of RL and the inherent randomness associated with solution approximations cause variations in the learned optimal values and policies. This has significantly hindered their successful deployment in real life applications where control responses need to meet dynamic performance criteria deterministically. Here we propose a novel phased actor in actor-critic (PAAC) method, aiming at improving policy gradient estimation and thus the quality of the control policy. Specifically, PAAC accounts for both $Q$ value and TD error in its actor update. We prove qualitative properties of PAAC for learning convergence of the value and policy, solution optimality, and stability of system dynamics. Additionally, we show variance reduction in policy gradient estimation. PAAC performance is systematically and quantitatively evaluated in this study using DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Results show that PAAC leads to significant performance improvement measured by total cost, learning variance, robustness, learning speed and success rate.

Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploiting gradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with the knowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset of training data points, an adversary can infer the private labels. These attacks are known as label inference attacks in VFL. In our work, we propose a novel framework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity to provide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFL scenario.

We also develop a novel energy-based sampling method to allow the network to be exposed to more informative OOD samples during the training phase. This is especially important when the auxiliary dataset is large. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks, improving the existing state-of-the-art FPR95 by 4% on our ImageNet experiment.

Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics.

Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies.

628,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12358v1,From $r$ to $Q^*$: Your Language Model is Secretly a Q-Function,"Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been a critical to the success of the latest generation of generative AI models. In response to the complex nature of the classical RLHF pipeline, direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as an alternative approach. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup, there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploys reinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a single arm. In this work we rectify this difference, first we theoretically show that we can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results, we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because of its token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of credit assignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classical search-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to the language generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPO policy. Empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningful improvement over the base DPO policy. Finally, we show how the choice of reference policy causes implicit rewards to decline during training. We conclude by discussing applications of our work, including information elicitation in multi-tun dialogue, reasoning, agentic applications and end-to-end training of multi-model systems.",2024-04-18

However, most GNN architectures aggregate information from all nodes and edges in a graph, regardless of their relevance to the task at hand, thus hindering the interpretability of their predictions. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose a GNN \emph{training} approach that jointly i) finds the most predictive subgraph by removing edges and/or nodes -- -\emph{without making assumptions about the subgraph structure} -- while ii) optimizing the performance of the graph classification task. To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier. Our empirical results on nine different graph classification datasets show that our method competes in performance with baselines while relying on significantly sparser subgraphs, leading to more interpretable GNN-based predictions.",2024-04-18

Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.",2024-04-18

  Dimensions in the Data Manifold","This paper introduces a new technique to measure the feature dependency of neural network models. The motivation is to better understand a model by querying whether it is using information from human-understandable features, e.g., anatomical shape, volume, or image texture. Our method is based on the principle that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of that feature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is ""removed"" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that corresponds to that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the feature dimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, as estimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model's performance changes on the modified test data set, with the target feature dimension removed. We test our method on deep neural network models trained on synthetic image data with known ground truth, an Alzheimer's disease prediction task using MRI and hippocampus segmentations from the OASIS-3 dataset, and a cell nuclei classification task using the Lizard dataset.",2024-04-18

Despite wide usability, their sensitive nature raises privacy and confidentially concerns, which limit potential use cases. To tackle these challenges, we explore the use of generative models to synthesize artificial, yet realistic EHRs. While diffusion-based methods have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generating other data modalities and overcome the training instability and mode collapse issues that plague previous GAN-based approaches, their applications in EHR generation remain underexplored. The discrete nature of tabular medical code data in EHRs poses challenges for high-quality data generation, especially for continuous diffusion models. To this end, we introduce a novel tabular EHR generation method, EHR-D3PM, which enables both unconditional and conditional generation using the discrete diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate that EHR-D3PM significantly outperforms existing generative baselines on comprehensive fidelity and utility metrics while maintaining less membership vulnerability risks. Furthermore, we show EHR-D3PM is effective as a data augmentation method and enhances performance on downstream tasks when combined with real data.",2024-04-18

In particular, we restrict the functions to the class of overparameterized two-layer neural networks and study (i) the convergence of the gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning of the neural network. As an initial step, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating a functional equation defined by conditional expectations via adversarial estimation, where the objective function is quadratic in the functional space. For this problem, we establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1} ) $ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$ denotes the time and $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural network. In terms of representation learning, our results show that the feature representation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from the initial one by the magnitude of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})$, measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance.

Use of RAG for combined understanding of multimodal data such as text, images and videos is appealing but two critical limitations exist: one-time, upfront capture of all content in large multimodal data as text descriptions entails high processing times, and not all information in the rich multimodal data is typically in the text descriptions. Since the user queries are not known apriori, developing a system for multimodal to text conversion and interactive querying of multimodal data is challenging.   To address these limitations, we propose iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable interactive querying of large corpus of multimodal data. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG quickly indexes large repositories of multimodal data, and in the incremental workflow, it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select portions of the multimodal data to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long multimodal to text conversion times, overcomes information loss issues by doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in multimodal data, and ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive querying of large, real-world multimodal data. Experimental results on real-world long videos demonstrate 23x to 25x faster video to text ingestion, while ensuring that quality of responses to interactive user queries is comparable to responses from a traditional RAG where all video data is converted to text upfront before any querying.",2024-04-18

Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions.

  Learning to Rank with Gradient Boosted Trees","Stochastic learning to rank (LTR) is a recent branch in the LTR field that concerns the optimization of probabilistic ranking models. Their probabilistic behavior enables certain ranking qualities that are impossible with deterministic models. For example, they can increase the diversity of displayed documents, increase fairness of exposure over documents, and better balance exploitation and exploration through randomization. A core difficulty in LTR is gradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have been limited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks). This is in stark contrast with the general field of LTR where Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) have long been considered the state-of-the-art.   In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first stochastic LTR method for GBDTs. Our main contribution is a novel estimator for the second-order derivatives, i.e., the Hessian matrix, which is a requirement for effective GBDTs. To efficiently compute both the first and second-order derivatives simultaneously, we incorporate our estimator into the existing PL-Rank framework, which was originally designed for first-order derivatives only. Our experimental results indicate that stochastic LTR without the Hessian has extremely poor performance, whilst the performance is competitive with the current state-of-the-art with our estimated Hessian. Thus, through the contribution of our novel Hessian estimation method, we have successfully introduced GBDTs to stochastic LTR.",2024-04-18

  Adaptation of Neural Predictive Models","In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.",2024-04-18

While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension.

Unlike the well-explored natural language-guided image inpainting, which excels in capturing semantic details, the relatively less-studied sketch-guided inpainting offers greater user control in specifying the object's shape and pose to be inpainted. As one of the early solutions to this task, we introduce a novel partial discrete diffusion process (PDDP). The forward pass of the PDDP corrupts the masked regions of the image and the backward pass reconstructs these masked regions conditioned on hand-drawn sketches using our proposed sketch-guided bi-directional transformer. The proposed novel transformer module accepts two inputs -- the image containing the masked region to be inpainted and the query sketch to model the reverse diffusion process. This strategy effectively addresses the domain gap between sketches and natural images, thereby, enhancing the quality of inpainting results. In the absence of a large-scale dataset specific to this task, we synthesize a dataset from the MS-COCO to train and extensively evaluate our proposed framework against various competent approaches in the literature.

However, deploying LDMs on resource-limited devices remains a complex issue, presenting challenges such as memory consumption and inference speed. To address this issue, we introduce LD-Pruner, a novel performance-preserving structured pruning method for compressing LDMs. Traditional pruning methods for deep neural networks are not tailored to the unique characteristics of LDMs, such as the high computational cost of training and the absence of a fast, straightforward and task-agnostic method for evaluating model performance. Our method tackles these challenges by leveraging the latent space during the pruning process, enabling us to effectively quantify the impact of pruning on model performance, independently of the task at hand. This targeted pruning of components with minimal impact on the output allows for faster convergence during training, as the model has less information to re-learn, thereby addressing the high computational cost of training. Consequently, our approach achieves a compressed model that offers improved inference speed and reduced parameter count, while maintaining minimal performance degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three different tasks: text-to-image (T2I) generation, Unconditional Image Generation (UIG) and Unconditional Audio Generation (UAG). Notably, we reduce the inference time of Stable Diffusion (SD) by 34.9% while simultaneously improving its FID by 5.2% on MS-COCO T2I benchmark.

  Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model: Pairwise Likelihood Ratios, Prior Knowledge, and
  Path Enumeration","Effective causal discovery is essential for learning the causal graph from observational data. The linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) operates under the assumption of a linear data generating process with non-Gaussian noise in determining the causal graph. Its assumption of unmeasured confounders being absent, however, poses practical limitations. In response, empirical research has shown that the reformulation of LiNGAM as a shortest path problem (LiNGAM-SPP) addresses this limitation. Within LiNGAM-SPP, mutual information is chosen to serve as the measure of independence. A challenge is introduced - parameter tuning is now needed due to its reliance on kNN mutual information estimators. The paper proposes a threefold enhancement to the LiNGAM-SPP framework.   First, the need for parameter tuning is eliminated by using the pairwise likelihood ratio in lieu of kNN-based mutual information. This substitution is validated on a general data generating process and benchmark real-world data sets, outperforming existing methods especially when given a larger set of features. The incorporation of prior knowledge is then enabled by a node-skipping strategy implemented on the graph representation of all causal orderings to eliminate violations based on the provided input of relative orderings. Flexibility relative to existing approaches is achieved. Last among the three enhancements is the utilization of the distribution of paths in the graph representation of all causal orderings. From this, crucial properties of the true causal graph such as the presence of unmeasured confounders and sparsity may be inferred. To some extent, the expected performance of the causal discovery algorithm may be predicted.

Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable to long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.",2024-04-18

However, the trial-and-error nature of RL and the inherent randomness associated with solution approximations cause variations in the learned optimal values and policies. This has significantly hindered their successful deployment in real life applications where control responses need to meet dynamic performance criteria deterministically. Here we propose a novel phased actor in actor-critic (PAAC) method, aiming at improving policy gradient estimation and thus the quality of the control policy. Specifically, PAAC accounts for both $Q$ value and TD error in its actor update. We prove qualitative properties of PAAC for learning convergence of the value and policy, solution optimality, and stability of system dynamics. Additionally, we show variance reduction in policy gradient estimation. PAAC performance is systematically and quantitatively evaluated in this study using DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Results show that PAAC leads to significant performance improvement measured by total cost, learning variance, robustness, learning speed and success rate. As PAAC can be piggybacked onto general policy gradient learning frameworks, we select well-known methods such as direct heuristic dynamic programming (dHDP), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and their variants to demonstrate the effectiveness of PAAC. Consequently we provide a unified view on these related policy gradient algorithms.",2024-04-18

Foundation models like CLIP providing zero-shot capabilities can help alleviate this challenge by leveraging vast amounts of image-caption pairs available on the internet. CLIP can be fine-tuned using domain specific image-caption pairs to improve classification performance. However, CLIP's pre-training data is not well-aligned with the medical jargon that clinicians use to perform diagnoses. The development of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has led to the possibility of leveraging the expressive nature of these models to generate rich text. Our goal is to use these models to generate caption text that aligns well with both the clinical lexicon and with the natural human language used in CLIP's pre-training data. Starting with captions used for images in PubMed articles, we extend them by passing the raw captions through an LLM fine-tuned on the field's several textbooks. We find that using captions generated by an expressive fine-tuned LLM like GPT-3.5 improves downstream zero-shot concept classification performance.",2024-04-19

Such capabilities are built upon a localized visual tokenization mechanism, where an image input is decomposed into regions of interest and subsequently encoded into region tokens. By integrating region tokens into user instructions and model responses, we seamlessly enable Groma to understand user-specified region inputs and ground its textual output to images. Besides, to enhance the grounded chat ability of Groma, we curate a visually grounded instruction dataset by leveraging the powerful GPT-4V and visual prompting techniques.

In the medical domain, a few previous studies attempted to convert two or more input radiographs into computed tomography (CT) volumes. Following their effort, we introduce a diffusion model-based technology that can rotate the anatomical content of any input radiograph in 3D space, potentially enabling the visualization of the entire anatomical content of the radiograph from any viewpoint in 3D. Similar to previous studies, we used CT volumes to create Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) as the training data for our model. However, we addressed two significant limitations encountered in previous studies: 1. We utilized conditional diffusion models with classifier-free guidance instead of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve higher mode coverage and improved output image quality, with the only trade-off being slower inference time, which is often less critical in medical applications; and 2. We demonstrated that the unreliable output of style transfer deep learning (DL) models, such as Cycle-GAN, to transfer the style of actual radiographs to DRRs could be replaced with a simple yet effective training transformation that randomly changes the pixel intensity histograms of the input and ground-truth imaging data during training. This transformation makes the diffusion model agnostic to any distribution variations of the input data pixel intensity, enabling the reliable training of a DL model on input DRRs and applying the exact same model to conventional radiographs (or DRRs) during inference.",2024-04-19

This distribution optimizes the local entropy of achieved goals within a contextual horizon, enhancing goal-spreading behaviors and facilitating deep exploration in states containing familiar structural patterns.

However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images.

Establishing a proper framework to leverage existing adult large-scale CXR datasets can thus enhance pediatric pneumonia detection performance. In this paper, we propose a three-branch parallel path learning-based framework that utilizes both adult and pediatric datasets to improve the performance of deep learning models on pediatric test datasets. The paths are trained with pediatric only, adult only, and both types of CXRs, respectively. Our proposed framework utilizes the multi-positive contrastive loss to cluster the classwise embeddings and the embedding similarity loss among these three parallel paths to make the classwise embeddings as close as possible to reduce the effect of domain shift. Experimental evaluations on open-access adult and pediatric CXR datasets show that the proposed method achieves a superior AUROC score of 0.8464 compared to 0.8348 obtained using the conventional approach of join training on both datasets. The proposed approach thus paves the way for generalized CAD models that are effective for both adult and pediatric age groups.",2024-04-19

However, there exist alternative, potentially weaker, forms of supervision, such as accompanying free-text reports, which are readily available. The task of performing localization with textual guidance is commonly referred to as phrase grounding. In this work, we use a publicly available Foundation Model, namely the Latent Diffusion Model, to solve this challenging task. This choice is supported by the fact that the Latent Diffusion Model, despite being generative in nature, contains mechanisms (cross-attention) that implicitly align visual and textual features, thus leading to intermediate representations that are suitable for the task at hand. In addition, we aim to perform this task in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without any further training on target data, meaning that the model's weights remain frozen. To this end, we devise strategies to select features and also refine them via post-processing without extra learnable parameters. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art approaches which explicitly enforce image-text alignment in a joint embedding space via contrastive learning.

  segmentation for medical images","Deep learning is dramatically transforming the field of medical imaging and radiology, enabling the identification of pathologies in medical images, including computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scans. However, the performance of deep learning models, particularly in segmentation tasks, is often limited by the need for extensive annotated datasets. To address this challenge, the capabilities of weakly supervised semantic segmentation are explored through the lens of Explainable AI and the generation of counterfactual explanations. The scope of this research is development of a novel counterfactual inpainting approach (COIN) that flips the predicted classification label from abnormal to normal by using a generative model. For instance, if the classifier deems an input medical image X as abnormal, indicating the presence of a pathology, the generative model aims to inpaint the abnormal region, thus reversing the classifier's original prediction label. The approach enables us to produce precise segmentations for pathologies without depending on pre-existing segmentation masks. Crucially, image-level labels are utilized, which are substantially easier to acquire than creating detailed segmentation masks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by segmenting synthetic targets and actual kidney tumors from CT images acquired from Tartu University Hospital in Estonia. The findings indicate that COIN greatly surpasses established attribution methods, such as RISE, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM, as well as an alternative counterfactual explanation method introduced by Singla et al.

  Differential Privacy","Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) exhibit significant potential in supervised learning model training by virtue of their ability to generate realistic labeled images. However, numerous studies have indicated the privacy leakage risk in CGANs models. The solution DPCGAN, incorporating the differential privacy framework, faces challenges such as heavy reliance on labeled data for model training and potential disruptions to original gradient information due to excessive gradient clipping, making it difficult to ensure model accuracy. To address these challenges, we present a privacy-preserving training framework called PATE-TripleGAN. This framework incorporates a classifier to pre-classify unlabeled data, establishing a three-party min-max game to reduce dependence on labeled data. Furthermore, we present a hybrid gradient desensitization algorithm based on the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and Differential Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) method. This algorithm allows the model to retain gradient information more effectively while ensuring privacy protection, thereby enhancing the model's utility. Privacy analysis and extensive experiments affirm that the PATE-TripleGAN model can generate a higher quality labeled image dataset while ensuring the privacy of the training data.",2024-04-19

This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.",2024-04-19

Traditional approaches often employ a static temperature throughout the KD process, which fails to address the nuanced complexities of samples with varying levels of difficulty and overlooks the distinct capabilities of different teacher-student pairings. This leads to a less-than-ideal transfer of knowledge. To improve the process of knowledge propagation, we proposed Dynamic Temperature Knowledge Distillation (DTKD) which introduces a dynamic, cooperative temperature control for both teacher and student models simultaneously within each training iterafion. In particular, we proposed ""\textbf{sharpness}"" as a metric to quantify the smoothness of a model's output distribution. By minimizing the sharpness difference between the teacher and the student, we can derive sample-specific temperatures for them respectively. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-2012 demonstrate that DTKD performs comparably to leading KD techniques, with added robustness in Target Class KD and None-target Class KD scenarios.The code is available at https://github.com/JinYu1998/DTKD.",2024-04-19

Additionally, the inherent sparsity of character usage complicates the generalization of learned representations. Prior research has explored radical-based sequences to overcome these issues, achieving progress in recognizing unseen characters. However, these approaches fail to fully exploit the inherent tree structure of such sequences. To address these limitations and leverage established data properties, we propose Formation Tree-CLIP (FT-CLIP). This model utilizes formation trees to represent characters and incorporates a dedicated tree encoder, significantly improving performance in both seen and unseen character recognition tasks. We further introduce masking for to both character images and tree nodes, enabling efficient and effective training.

The primary challenges include the complexity of synchronization and load balancing between CPUs and GPUs, the variance in input data distribution, and the use of different communication devices and topologies (e.g., NVLink, PCIe, network cards) that connect multiple compute devices, coupled with the desire for flexible training configurations. Built on top of our prior work for single-GPU platforms, we address these challenges and enable multi-GPU performance modeling by incorporating (1) data-distribution-aware performance models for embedding table lookup, and (2) data movement prediction of communication collectives, into our upgraded performance modeling pipeline equipped with inter-and intra-rank synchronization for ML workloads trained on multi-GPU platforms. Beyond accurately predicting the per-iteration training time of DLRM models with random configurations with a geomean error of 5.21% on two multi-GPU platforms, our prediction pipeline generalizes well to other types of ML workloads, such as Transformer-based NLP models with a geomean error of 3.00%.

Addressing an inherent conflict of confidentiality and transparency, we introduce a two-step proving and verification (2PV) method that we apply to central system procedures: a registration workflow that enables non-disclosing verification of device certificates and a learning workflow that extends existing blockchain and ZKP-based FL systems through non-disclosing data authenticity proofs.

With the rise of counterfeit face generation techniques, the challenge posed by digitally edited faces to face anti-spoofing is escalating. Existing FAS technologies primarily focus on intercepting physically forged faces and lack a robust solution for cross-domain FAS challenges. Moreover, determining an appropriate threshold to achieve optimal deployment results remains an issue for intra-domain FAS. To address these issues, we propose a visualization method that intuitively reflects the training outcomes of models by visualizing the prediction results on datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that employing data augmentation techniques, such as downsampling and Gaussian blur, can effectively enhance performance on cross-domain tasks. Building upon our data visualization approach, we also introduce a methodology for setting threshold values based on the distribution of the training dataset.

To address these challenges, we propose QUTE, a novel resource-efficient early-exit-assisted ensemble architecture optimized for tinyML models. QUTE adds additional output blocks at the final exit of the base network and distills the knowledge of early-exits into these blocks to create a diverse and lightweight ensemble architecture. Our results show that QUTE outperforms popular prior works, and improves the quality of uncertainty estimates by 6% with 3.1x lower model size on average compared to the most relevant prior work.

  Knowledge Distillation","Over the past year, the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has experienced an exponential surge, largely due to the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have exhibited the most effective performance in a range of domains within the Natural Language Processing and Generation domains. However, their application in domain-specific tasks, such as paraphrasing, presents significant challenges. The extensive number of parameters makes them difficult to operate on commercial hardware, and they require substantial time for inference, leading to high costs in a production setting. In this study, we tackle these obstacles by employing LLMs to develop three distinct models for the paraphrasing field, applying a method referred to as sequence-level knowledge distillation. These distilled models are capable of maintaining the quality of paraphrases generated by the LLM. They demonstrate faster inference times and the ability to generate diverse paraphrases of comparable quality. A notable characteristic of these models is their ability to exhibit syntactic diversity while also preserving lexical diversity, features previously uncommon due to existing data quality issues in datasets and not typically observed in neural-based approaches. Human evaluation of our models shows that there is only a 4% drop in performance compared to the LLM teacher model used in the distillation process, despite being 1000 times smaller. This research provides a significant contribution to the NLG field, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution for paraphrasing tasks.",2024-04-19

In this paper, we propose a method to quantify such a dissimilarity in the interval 0 to 100%, and from the perspective of the data feature space. The proposed method is based on adversarial validation, which is an approach that can check whether sample data and prediction locations can be separated with a binary classifier. To study the effectiveness and generality of our method, we tested it on a series of experiments based on both synthetic and real datasets and with gradually increasing dissimilarities. Results show that the proposed method can successfully quantify dissimilarity across the entire range of values. Next to this, we studied how dissimilarity affects CV evaluations by comparing the results of random CV and of two spatial CV methods, namely block and spatial+ CV. Our results showed that CV evaluations follow similar patterns in all datasets and predictions: when dissimilarity is low (usually lower than 30%), random CV provides the most accurate evaluation results. As dissimilarity increases, spatial CV methods, especially spatial+ CV, become more and more accurate and even outperforming random CV. When dissimilarity is high (>=90%), no CV method provides accurate evaluations. These results show the importance of considering feature space dissimilarity when working with geospatial machine learning predictions, and can help researchers and practitioners to select more suitable CV methods for evaluating their predictions.",2024-04-19

  Scarce Labeled Data","While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks.

SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.",2024-04-22

To this end we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate seven S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when judging holistically the toxicity of a prompt, and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microagressions, bias).

In this paper, we introduce a novel fake traffic injection (FTI) attack, designed to undermine the FL-based WTP system by injecting fabricated traffic distributions with minimal knowledge. We further propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), which strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a specific percentile range estimated through statistical methods in each dimension.

  Data","Learning from preference labels plays a crucial role in fine-tuning large language models. There are several distinct approaches for preference fine-tuning, including supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), and contrastive learning. Different methods come with different implementation tradeoffs and performance differences, and existing empirical findings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that online RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others find (offline) contrastive or even purely supervised methods sufficient. This raises a natural question: what kind of approaches are important for fine-tuning with preference data and why? In this paper, we answer this question by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems. Our main finding is that, in general, approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a ""negative gradient"") outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives. We conceptualize our insights and unify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion of mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions. Mode-seeking objectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical distribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to relocate masses across bins more effectively.

However, many works in dynamic spectrum access do not consider the impact of imperfect sensing information such as mis-detected channels, which the additional information available in joint SSRA can help remediate. In this work, we examine joint SSRA as an optimization which seeks to maximize a CRN's net communication rate subject to constraints on channel sensing, channel access, and transmit power. Given the non-trivial nature of the problem, we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable a network of secondary users to dynamically access unoccupied spectrum via only local test statistics, formulated under the energy detection paradigm of spectrum sensing. In doing so, we develop a novel multi-agent implementation of hybrid soft actor critic, MHSAC, based on the QMIX mixing scheme.

However, current explanation methods for DNNs commonly leave it to the human observer to distinguish relevant explanations from spurious noise. This is not feasible anymore when going from easily human-accessible data such as images to more complex data such as genome sequences. To facilitate the accessibility of DNN outputs from such complex data and to increase explainability, we present a modification of the widely used explanation method layer-wise relevance propagation. Our approach enforces sparsity directly by pruning the relevance propagation for the different layers. Thereby, we achieve sparser relevance attributions for the input features as well as for the intermediate layers. As the relevance propagation is input-specific, we aim to prune the relevance propagation rather than the underlying model architecture. This allows to prune different neurons for different inputs and hence, might be more appropriate to the local nature of explanation methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we evaluate it on two types of data, images and genomic sequences. We show that our modification indeed leads to noise reduction and concentrates relevance on the most important features compared to the baseline.",2024-04-22

In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-based CF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CF employs a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrix decompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardware components (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-item similarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our own polynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals without explicit matrix decompositions.

However, existing diffusion model-based recommender systems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain crucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this gap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along with multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds random noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process accommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop autoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions. CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module, responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item interactions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and 2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order connectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b) Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the embeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original cross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that scales linearly with the number of users or items.",2024-04-22

Training of such a model over the continental United States has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in unseen catchments) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model.

  Fusion","Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Dispatch (STAD) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, e.g., attention, STAD employs a centralized strategy. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively. SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAD module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically.

The standard cross-entropy loss however assumes data to be categorically distributed, which may often not be the case in practice. In contrast, InfoNCE does not rely on such an explicit assumption but instead implicitly estimates the true conditional through negative sampling. Unfortunately, it cannot be combined with soft targets in its standard formulation, hindering its use in combination with sophisticated training strategies. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a principled loss function that is compatible with probabilistic targets. Our new soft target InfoNCE loss is conceptually simple, efficient to compute, and can be derived within the framework of noise contrastive estimation. Using a toy example, we demonstrate shortcomings of the categorical distribution assumption of cross-entropy, and discuss implications of sampling from soft distributions. We observe that soft target InfoNCE performs on par with strong soft target cross-entropy baselines and outperforms hard target NLL and InfoNCE losses on popular benchmarks, including ImageNet.

To overcome these hardware constraints, we propose Multi-View Disentanglement (MVD), which uses multiple cameras to learn a policy that achieves zero-shot generalisation to any single camera from the training set. Our approach is a self-supervised auxiliary task for RL that learns a disentangled representation from multiple cameras, with a shared representation that is aligned across all cameras to allow generalisation to a single camera, and a private representation that is camera-specific. We show experimentally that an RL agent trained on a single third-person camera is unable to learn an optimal policy in many control tasks; but, our approach, benefiting from multiple cameras during training, is able to solve the task using only the same single third-person camera.",2024-04-22

An Empirical Study,"Meta's LLaMA family has become one of the most powerful open-source Large Language Model (LLM) series. Notably, LLaMA3 models have recently been released and achieve impressive performance across various with super-large scale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of low-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-limited scenarios, we explore LLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration holds the potential to unveil new insights and challenges for low-bit quantization of LLaMA3 and other forthcoming LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation problems that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we evaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA-finetuning methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and diverse datasets to comprehensively reveal LLaMA3's low-bit quantization performance. Our experiment results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers non-negligent degradation in these scenarios, especially in ultra-low bit-width. This highlights the significant performance gap under low bit-width that needs to be bridged in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, pushing the LLMs to lower bit-width with higher accuracy for being practical.

  Heterogeneous Environments","Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables the collaborative training of a shared global model across distributed clients while keeping the data decentralized. Recent works on designing systems for efficient FL have shown that utilizing serverless computing technologies, particularly Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) for FL, can enhance resource efficiency, reduce training costs, and alleviate the complex infrastructure management burden on data holders. However, current serverless FL systems still suffer from the presence of stragglers, i.e., slow clients that impede the collaborative training process. While strategies aimed at mitigating stragglers in these systems have been proposed, they overlook the diverse hardware resource configurations among FL clients. To this end, we present Apodotiko, a novel asynchronous training strategy designed for serverless FL. Our strategy incorporates a scoring mechanism that evaluates each client's hardware capacity and dataset size to intelligently prioritize and select clients for each training round, thereby minimizing the effects of stragglers on system performance. We comprehensively evaluate Apodotiko across diverse datasets, considering a mix of CPU and GPU clients, and compare its performance against five other FL training strategies. Results from our experiments demonstrate that Apodotiko outperforms other FL training strategies, achieving an average speedup of 2.75x and a maximum speedup of 7.03x. Furthermore, our strategy significantly reduces cold starts by a factor of four on average, demonstrating suitability in serverless environments.",2024-04-22

This is also a major step towards fostering sustainable transportation. As behaviour may evolve over time, we also face the question of detecting concept drift in the data. This necessitates using appropriate methods to address potential concept drift. In particular, it is necessary to decide whether batch or stream mining methods should be used to develop periodically updated TMC models. To address the challenge of the development of TMC models, we propose the novel Incremental Ensemble of Batch and Stream Models (IEBSM) method aimed at adapting travel mode choice classifiers to concept drift possibly occurring in the data. It relies on the combination of drift detectors with batch learning and stream mining models. We compare it against batch and incremental learners, including methods relying on active drift detection. Experiments with varied travel mode data sets representing both city and country levels show that the IEBSM method both detects drift in travel mode data and successfully adapts the models to evolving travel mode choice data. The method has a higher rank than batch and stream learners.",2024-04-22

Current approaches to creating unlearnable data involve incorporating small, specially designed noises, but these methods strictly limit data usability, overlooking its potential usage in authorized scenarios. In this paper, we extend the concept of unlearnable data to conditional data learnability and introduce \textbf{U}n\textbf{G}eneralizable \textbf{E}xamples (UGEs). UGEs exhibit learnability for authorized users while maintaining unlearnability for potential hackers. The protector defines the authorized network and optimizes UGEs to match the gradients of the original data and its ungeneralizable version, ensuring learnability. To prevent unauthorized learning, UGEs are trained by maximizing a designated distance loss in a common feature space. Additionally, to further safeguard the authorized side from potential attacks, we introduce additional undistillation optimization. Experimental results on multiple datasets and various networks demonstrate that the proposed UGEs framework preserves data usability while reducing training performance on hacker networks, even under different types of attacks.",2024-04-22

With these models taking on increasingly central roles in various applications, the need to understand their behavior and enhance interpretability has become paramount. To investigate the impact of changes in training data on a pre-trained model, a common approach is leave-one-out retraining. This entails systematically altering the training dataset by removing specific samples to observe resulting changes within the model. However, retraining the model for each altered dataset presents a significant computational challenge, given the need to perform this operation for every dataset variation. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for assessing data impact, comprising offline training and online evaluation stages. During the offline training phase, we approximate the influence of training data on the target model through a distilled synset, formulated as a reversed gradient matching problem. For online evaluation, we expedite the leave-one-out process using the synset, which is then utilized to compute the attribution matrix based on the evaluation objective. Experimental evaluations, including training data attribution and assessments of data quality, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable model behavior evaluation while significantly speeding up the process compared to the direct retraining method.",2024-04-22

  Models -- Extended Version","We are witnessing an increasing availability of streaming data that may contain valuable information on the underlying processes. It is thus attractive to be able to deploy machine learning models on edge devices near sensors such that decisions can be made instantaneously, rather than first having to transmit incoming data to servers. To enable deployment on edge devices with limited storage and computational capabilities, the full-precision parameters in standard models can be quantized to use fewer bits. The resulting quantized models are then calibrated using back-propagation and full training data to ensure accuracy. This one-time calibration works for deployments in static environments. However, model deployment in dynamic edge environments call for continual calibration to adaptively adjust quantized models to fit new incoming data, which may have different distributions. The first difficulty in enabling continual calibration on the edge is that the full training data may be too large and thus not always available on edge devices. The second difficulty is that the use of back-propagation on the edge for repeated calibration is too expensive. We propose QCore to enable continual calibration on the edge. First, it compresses the full training data into a small subset to enable effective calibration of quantized models with different bit-widths. We also propose means of updating the subset when new streaming data arrives to reflect changes in the environment, while not forgetting earlier training data. Second, we propose a small bit-flipping network that works with the subset to update quantized model parameters, thus enabling efficient continual calibration without back-propagation. An experimental study, conducted with real-world data in a continual learning setting, offers insight into the properties of QCore and shows that it is capable of outperforming strong baseline methods.",2024-04-22

To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance.

Yet, the learning objectives and therefore the representation topologies of the two tasks are fundamentally different: classification targets class separation, leading to disconnected representations, whereas regression requires ordinality with respect to the target, leading to continuous representations. We thus wonder how the effectiveness of a regression representation is influenced by its topology, with evaluation based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle.   The IB principle is an important framework that provides principles for learning effectiveness representations. We establish two connections between it and the topology of regression representations. The first connection reveals that a lower intrinsic dimension of the feature space implies a reduced complexity of the representation Z. This complexity can be quantified as the conditional entropy of Z on the target space Y and serves as an upper bound on the generalization error. The second connection suggests learning a feature space that is topologically similar to the target space will better align with the IB principle. Based on these two connections, we introduce PH-Reg, a regularizer specific to regression that matches the intrinsic dimension and topology of the feature space with the target space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world regression tasks demonstrate the benefits of PH-Reg.",2024-04-22

Recent research establishes a connection between Online Mirror Descent (OMD) and RM+, paving the way for an optimistic variant PRM+ and its extension PCFR+.

Robust RL methods account for this issue by approximating a worst-case value function during training, but they can be sensitive to approximation errors in the value function and its gradient before training is complete. In this paper, we hypothesize that Lipschitz regularization can help condition the approximated value function gradients, leading to improved robustness after training. We test this hypothesis by combining Lipschitz regularization with an application of Fast Gradient Sign Method to reduce approximation errors when evaluating the value function under adversarial perturbations. Our empirical results demonstrate the benefits of this approach over prior work on a number of continuous control benchmarks.",2024-04-22

While the significance of dataset quality is generally recognized, explicit investigations into its impact within the RLHF framework, to our knowledge, have been limited. This paper addresses the issue of text quality within the preference dataset by focusing on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an increasingly adopted reward-model-free RLHF method. We confirm that text quality significantly influences the performance of models optimized with DPO more than those optimized with reward-model-based RLHF. Building on this new insight, we propose an extension of DPO, termed filtered direct preference optimization (fDPO). fDPO uses a trained reward model to monitor the quality of texts within the preference dataset during DPO training. Samples of lower quality are discarded based on comparisons with texts generated by the model being optimized, resulting in a more accurate dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO enhances the final model performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/filtered-dpo.",2024-04-22

We introduce Collaborative Adaptation (ColA) with Gradient Learning (GL), a parameter-free, model-agnostic fine-tuning approach that decouples the computation of the gradient of hidden representations and parameters.

In most FL work, all clients train a single learning task. However, the recent proliferation of FL applications may increasingly require multiple FL tasks to be trained simultaneously, sharing clients' computing and communication resources, which we call Multiple-Model Federated Learning (MMFL). Current MMFL algorithms use naive average-based client-task allocation schemes that can lead to unfair performance when FL tasks have heterogeneous difficulty levels, e.g., tasks with larger models may need more rounds and data to train. Just as naively allocating resources to generic computing jobs with heterogeneous resource needs can lead to unfair outcomes, naive allocation of clients to FL tasks can lead to unfairness, with some tasks having excessively long training times, or lower converged accuracies. Furthermore, in the FL setting, since clients are typically not paid for their training effort, we face a further challenge that some clients may not even be willing to train some tasks, e.g., due to high computational costs, which may exacerbate unfairness in training outcomes across tasks. We address both challenges by firstly designing FedFairMMFL, a difficulty-aware algorithm that dynamically allocates clients to tasks in each training round. We provide guarantees on airness and FedFairMMFL's convergence rate. We then propose a novel auction design that incentivizes clients to train multiple tasks, so as to fairly distribute clients' training efforts across the tasks. We show how our fairness-based learning and incentive mechanisms impact training convergence and finally evaluate our algorithm with multiple sets of learning tasks on real world datasets.",2024-04-22

To train learned optimizers, we use a gradient-based algorithm to directly minimize the PAC-Bayes upper bound. Numerical experiments in signal processing, control, and meta-learning showcase the ability of our framework to provide strong generalization guarantees for both classical and learned optimizers given a fixed budget of iterations.

Mitigating this issue often requires expensive spurious attribute (group) labels or relies on trained ERM models to infer group labels when group information is unavailable. However, the significant performance gap in worst-group accuracy between using pseudo group labels and using oracle group labels inspires us to consider further improving group robustness through preciser group inference. Therefore, we propose GIC, a novel method that accurately infers group labels, resulting in improved worst-group performance. GIC trains a spurious attribute classifier based on two key properties of spurious correlations: (1) high correlation between spurious attributes and true labels, and (2) variability in this correlation between datasets with different group distributions. Empirical studies on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GIC in inferring group labels, and combining GIC with various downstream invariant learning methods improves worst-group accuracy, showcasing its powerful flexibility. Additionally, through analyzing the misclassifications in GIC, we identify an interesting phenomenon called semantic consistency, which may contribute to better decoupling the association between spurious attributes and labels, thereby mitigating spurious correlation.",2024-04-22

To address this issue, our recent paper introduces Estimation Network Design (END), a graph theoretical language for the analysis and design of distributed iterations. END algorithms can be tuned to exploit the sparsity of specific problem instances, reducing communication overhead and minimizing redundancy, yet without requiring case-by-case convergence analysis. In this paper, we showcase the flexility of END in the context of distributed optimization.

In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data and using it to define a prompt policy that drives future response generation. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages a large language model (LLM) to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, for evaluation using a GPT-4 simulated user. We compare with algorithms that directly retrieve user edits but do not learn descriptive preference, and algorithms that learn context-agnostic preference. On both tasks, CIPHER achieves the lowest edit distance cost and learns preferences that show significant similarity to the ground truth preferences",2024-04-23

An increasing interest is observed in deep learning approaches that seamlessly integrate mathematical principles for investigating numerical PDEs.

This approach, within the framework of the boundary integral method, designs a network to approximate the solution operator for the corresponding integral equations by mapping the parameters, inhomogeneous terms and boundary information of PDEs to the boundary density functions, which can be regarded as the solution of the integral equations. The models are trained using data generated by the Cartesian grid-based KFBI algorithm, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. It accurately predicts density functions across diverse boundary conditions and parameters within the same class of equations. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained model can directly infer the boundary density function with satisfactory precision, obviating the need for iterative steps in solving boundary integral equations.

The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets.

Improving the architecture and training protocol on top of this increased average downstream performance to 0.801 AUROC. We then demonstrated the consistency of our optimization through a rigorous evaluation across 25 diverse clinical prediction tasks.

One major question is whether these models ""memorize"" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\textit{how we define memorization}$. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself. In other words, these strings can be ""compressed"" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.

Our framework offers a structured guideline for parameter selection and the range for dynamics randomization in simulation, thus facilitating a safe sim-to-real transfer. The learned policy using our framework enabled jumps across distances of 55 cm and heights of 38 cm. The results are, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest and longest running jumps demonstrated by an RL-based control policy in a real quadruped robot. Note that the achieved jumping height is approximately 85% of that obtained from a state-of-the-art trajectory optimization method, which can be seen as the physical limit for the given robot hardware. In addition, our control policy accomplished stable walking at speeds up to 2 m/s in the forward and backward directions, and 1 m/s in the sideway direction.",2024-04-23

  Perturbations That Efficiently Fool Customized Diffusion Models","Diffusion models (DMs) embark a new era of generative modeling and offer more opportunities for efficient generating high-quality and realistic data samples. However, their widespread use has also brought forth new challenges in model security, which motivates the creation of more effective adversarial attackers on DMs to understand its vulnerability. We propose CAAT, a simple but generic and efficient approach that does not require costly training to effectively fool latent diffusion models (LDMs). The approach is based on the observation that cross-attention layers exhibits higher sensitivity to gradient change, allowing for leveraging subtle perturbations on published images to significantly corrupt the generated images. We show that a subtle perturbation on an image can significantly impact the cross-attention layers, thus changing the mapping between text and image during the fine-tuning of customized diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAAT is compatible with diverse diffusion models and outperforms baseline attack methods in a more effective (more noise) and efficient (twice as fast as Anti-DreamBooth and Mist) manner.",2024-04-23

In peak periods, it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request due to the limited budget of computational resources. The recommendation with a cache is a solution to this problem, where a user-wise result cache is used to provide recommendations when the recommender system cannot afford a real-time computation. However, the cached recommendations are usually suboptimal compared to real-time computation, and it is challenging to determine the items in the cache for each user. In this paper, we provide a cache-aware reinforcement learning (CARL) method to jointly optimize the recommendation by real-time computation and by the cache. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process with user states and a cache state, where the cache state represents whether the recommender system performs recommendations by real-time computation or by the cache. The computational load of the recommender system determines the cache state. We perform reinforcement learning based on such a model to improve user engagement over multiple requests. Moreover, we show that the cache will introduce a challenge called critic dependency, which deteriorates the performance of reinforcement learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose an eigenfunction learning (EL) method to learn independent critics for CARL. Experiments show that CARL can significantly improve the users' engagement when considering the result cache. CARL has been fully launched in Kwai app, serving over 100 million users.",2024-04-23

However, existing studies show that some recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, particularly those that involve learning schemes. A poisoning attack is where an adversary injects carefully crafted data into the process of training a model, with the goal of manipulating the system's final recommendations. Based on recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such attacks have gained importance recently. While numerous countermeasures to poisoning attacks have been developed, they have not yet been systematically linked to the properties of the attacks. Consequently, assessing the respective risks and potential success of mitigation strategies is difficult, if not impossible. This survey aims to fill this gap by primarily focusing on poisoning attacks and their countermeasures. This is in contrast to prior surveys that mainly focus on attacks and their detection methods. Through an exhaustive literature review, we provide a novel taxonomy for poisoning attacks, formalise its dimensions, and accordingly organise 30+ attacks described in the literature. Further, we review 40+ countermeasures to detect and/or prevent poisoning attacks, evaluating their effectiveness against specific types of attacks. This comprehensive survey should serve as a point of reference for protecting recommender systems against poisoning attacks. The article concludes with a discussion on open issues in the field and impactful directions for future research.

Our main contribution is the definition of the NT-Xent-AM loss and the study of the importance of Additive Margin (AM) in SimCLR and MoCo SSL methods to further separate positive from negative pairs. Despite class collisions, we show that AM enhances the compactness of same-speaker embeddings and reduces the number of false negatives and false positives on SV.

Expectation propagation (EP) and its variants are widely used for MIMO detection and have achieved the best performance. However, EP-based solvers fail to capture the correlation between unknown variables, leading to loss of information, and in addition, they are computationally expensive. In this paper, we show that the real-valued system can be modeled as spectral signal convolution on graph, through which the correlation between unknown variables can be captured. Based on this analysis, we propose graph convolution-enhanced expectation propagation (GCEPNet), a graph convolution-enhanced EP detector. GCEPNet incorporates data-dependent attention scores into Chebyshev polynomial for powerful graph convolution with better generalization capacity. It enables a better estimation of the cavity distribution for EP and empirically achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIMO detection performance with much faster inference speed.

GGN has been found particularly interesting for practical training of deep neural networks, not only for its impressive convergence speed, but also for its close relation with neural tangent kernel regression, which is central to recent studies that aim to understand the optimization and generalization properties of neural networks. This work studies a GGN method for optimizing a two-layer neural network with explicit regularization. In particular, we consider a class of generalized self-concordant (GSC) functions that provide smooth approximations to commonly-used penalty terms in the objective function of the optimization problem.

In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). With RCS data, we found that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of time trajectories or Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, often leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method, Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD), providing accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimize the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, demonstrating its superiority in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions rather than a normal distribution. These results effectively address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data.",2024-04-23

This paper seeks to bridge this gap between network architecture design and CL, and to present a holistic study on the impact of network architectures on CL.

These methods typically require extensive data for training due to their large parameter sets. However, existing works do not exploit the full potential of EHR data. A significant challenge arises from the infrequent occurrence of many medical codes within EHR data, limiting their clinical applicability. Current research often lacks in critical areas: 1) incorporating disease domain knowledge; 2) heterogeneously learning disease representations with rich meanings; 3) capturing the temporal dynamics of disease progression.

However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of the trigger, we present a poisoning attack against LLMs that is triggered by a generation/output condition-token limitation, which is a commonly adopted strategy by users for reducing costs. The poisoned model performs normally for output without token limitation, while becomes harmful for output with limited tokens. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation limitation by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and knowledge domains. For instance, with only 20 generated poisoning examples against GPT-3.5-turbo, BrieFool achieves a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a 9.28/10 average Harmfulness Score (HS) under token limitation conditions while maintaining the benign performance.",2024-04-23

  Variance-Reduced Gradients","We show that, for finite-sum minimization problems, incorporating partial second-order information of the objective function can dramatically improve the robustness to mini-batch size of variance-reduced stochastic gradient methods, making them more scalable while retaining their benefits over traditional Newton-type approaches. We demonstrate this phenomenon on a prototypical stochastic second-order algorithm, called Mini-Batch Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton ($\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$), which combines variance-reduced gradient estimates with access to an approximate Hessian oracle. In particular, we show that when the data size $n$ is sufficiently large, i.e., $n\gg \alpha^2\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number and $\alpha$ is the Hessian approximation factor, then $\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$ achieves a fast linear convergence rate that is independent of the gradient mini-batch size $b$, as long $b$ is in the range between $1$ and $b_{\max}=O(n/(\alpha \log n))$. Only after increasing the mini-batch size past this critical point $b_{\max}$, the method begins to transition into a standard Newton-type algorithm which is much more sensitive to the Hessian approximation quality. We demonstrate this phenomenon empirically on benchmark optimization tasks showing that, after tuning the step size, the convergence rate of $\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$ remains fast for a wide range of mini-batch sizes, and the dependence of the phase transition point $b_{\max}$ on the Hessian approximation factor $\alpha$ aligns with our theoretical predictions.",2024-04-23

Several HLS benchmarks and datasets are available for the research community to evaluate their methodologies. Unfortunately, these resources are limited and may not be sufficient for complex, multi-component system-level explorations. Generating new data using existing HLS benchmarks can be cumbersome, given the expertise and time required to effectively generate data for different HLS designs and directives. As a result, synthetic data has been used in prior work to evaluate system-level HLS DSE. However, the fidelity of the synthetic data to real data is often unclear, leading to uncertainty about the quality of system-level HLS DSE. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Vaegan, that employs generative machine learning to generate synthetic data that is robust enough to support complex system-level HLS DSE experiments that would be unattainable with only the currently available data. We explore and adapt a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for this task and evaluate our approach using state-of-the-art datasets and metrics.

This paper introduces a form of gradient guidance for adapting or fine-tuning diffusion models towards user-specified optimization objectives. We study the theoretic aspects of a guided score-based sampling process, linking the gradient-guided diffusion model to first-order optimization. We show that adding gradient guidance to the sampling process of a pre-trained diffusion model is essentially equivalent to solving a regularized optimization problem, where the regularization term acts as a prior determined by the pre-training data. Diffusion models are able to learn data's latent subspace, however, explicitly adding the gradient of an external objective function to the sample process would jeopardize the structure in generated samples. To remedy this issue, we consider a modified form of gradient guidance based on a forward prediction loss, which leverages the pre-trained score function to preserve the latent structure in generated samples. We further consider an iteratively fine-tuned version of gradient-guided diffusion where one can query gradients at newly generated data points and update the score network using new samples. This process mimics a first-order optimization iteration in expectation, for which we proved O(1/K) convergence rate to the global optimum when the objective function is concave.",2024-04-23

In this work, we explore task-imbalanced continual learning (TICL) scenarios where the distribution of task data is non-uniform across the whole learning process. We find that imbalanced tasks significantly challenge the capability of models to control the trade-off between stability and plasticity from the perspective of recent prompt-based continual learning methods. On top of the above finding, we propose Dynamically Anchored Prompting (DAP), a prompt-based method that only maintains a single general prompt to adapt to the shifts within a task stream dynamically. This general prompt is regularized in the prompt space with two specifically designed prompt anchors, called boosting anchor and stabilizing anchor, to balance stability and plasticity in TICL. Remarkably, DAP achieves this balance by only storing a prompt across the data stream, therefore offering a substantial advantage in rehearsal-free CL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DAP results in 4.5% to 15% absolute improvements over state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks under task-imbalanced settings.

  Architecture Search","Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a key tool in identifying optimal configurations of deep neural networks tailored to specific tasks. However, training and assessing numerous architectures introduces considerable computational overhead. One method to mitigating this is through performance predictors, which offer a means to estimate the potential of an architecture without exhaustive training. Given that neural architectures fundamentally resemble Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become an apparent choice for such predictive tasks. Nevertheless, the scarcity of training data can impact the precision of GNN-based predictors. To address this, we introduce a novel GNN predictor for NAS. This predictor renders neural architectures into vector representations by combining both the conventional and inverse graph views. Additionally, we incorporate a customized training loss within the GNN predictor to ensure efficient utilization of both types of representations. We subsequently assessed our method through experiments on benchmark datasets including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and the DARTS search space, with a training dataset ranging from 50 to 400 samples. Benchmarked against leading GNN predictors, the experimental results showcase a significant improvement in prediction accuracy, with a 3%--16% increase in Kendall-tau correlation.

  Network Performance","Artificial neural networks have advanced due to scaling dimensions, but conventional computing faces inefficiency due to the von Neumann bottleneck. In-memory computation architectures, like memristors, offer promise but face challenges due to hardware non-idealities. This work proposes and experimentally demonstrates layer ensemble averaging, a technique to map pre-trained neural network solutions from software to defective hardware crossbars of emerging memory devices and reliably attain near-software performance on inference. The approach is investigated using a custom 20,000-device hardware prototyping platform on a continual learning problem where a network must learn new tasks without catastrophically forgetting previously learned information. Results demonstrate that by trading off the number of devices required for layer mapping, layer ensemble averaging can reliably boost defective memristive network performance up to the software baseline. For the investigated problem, the average multi-task classification accuracy improves from 61 % to 72 % (< 1 % of software baseline) using the proposed approach.",2024-04-24

In this paper, we instead study the dual form of the original RL formulation to propose the first differential RL framework that can handle settings with limited training samples and short-length episodes. Our approach introduces Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise and stage-wise iteration method that optimizes policies encoded by local-movement operators. We prove a pointwise convergence estimate for DPO and provide a regret bound comparable with current theoretical works. Such pointwise estimate ensures that the learned policy matches the optimal path uniformly across different steps. We then apply DPO to a class of practical RL problems which search for optimal configurations with Lagrangian rewards.

We also introduce a flexible transformer-based model for general-purpose ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple video settings covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences.

Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing. To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning.

Building upon this, recent studies, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, have proposed the use of prompt learning, where context within a prompt is replaced with learnable vectors, leading to significant improvements over manually crafted prompts. However, the performance improvement for unseen classes is still marginal, and to tackle this problem, data augmentation has been frequently used in traditional zero-shot learning techniques. Through our experiments, we have identified important issues in CoOp and CoCoOp: the context learned through traditional image augmentation is biased toward seen classes, negatively impacting generalization to unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose adversarial token embedding to disentangle low-level visual augmentation features from high-level class information when inducing bias in learnable prompts. Through our novel mechanism called ""Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning"", AAPL, we guide the learnable context to effectively extract text features by focusing on high-level features for unseen classes.

Freeze-thaw BO offers a promising grey-box alternative, strategically allocating scarce resources incrementally to different configurations. However, the frequent surrogate model updates inherent to this approach pose challenges for existing methods, requiring retraining or fine-tuning their neural network surrogates online, introducing overhead, instability, and hyper-hyperparameters. In this work, we propose FT-PFN, a novel surrogate for Freeze-thaw style BO. FT-PFN is a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that leverages the transformers' in-context learning ability to efficiently and reliably do Bayesian learning curve extrapolation in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis across three benchmark suites shows that the predictions made by FT-PFN are more accurate and 10-100 times faster than those of the deep Gaussian process and deep ensemble surrogates used in previous work.

Suppose we have a moderately trained LLM (e.g., trained to align with human preference) in hand, can we further exploit its potential and cheaply acquire a stronger model? In this paper, we propose a simple method called ExPO to boost LLMs' alignment with human preference. ExPO assumes that a medium-aligned model can be interpolated between a less-aligned (weaker) model, e.g., the initial SFT model, and a better-aligned (stronger) one, thereby directly obtaining this stronger model by extrapolating from the weights of the former two relatively weaker models. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, we show that ExPO pushes models trained with less preference data (e.g., 10% or 20%) to reach and even surpass the fully-trained one, without any additional training. Furthermore, ExPO also significantly improves off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF models and exhibits decent scalability across model sizes from 7B to 70B.

Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping) and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative rewards via a direct policy parameterization between two completions to a prompt, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice.

The first is the fairness demonstrated on the generated sequences, which is only evaluated on the outputs while agnostic to the prompts/models used. The second is the inherent fairness of the generative AI model, which requires that fairness be manifested when input prompts are neutral, that is, they do not explicitly instruct the generative AI to produce a particular type of output.

Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques.   In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes.

Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding.

For the standard input-output predictive setting, we categorize the set of graphs considered in the literature into two distinct groups: (i) those in which the empirical risk minimizer across training domains gives domain-general representations and (ii) those where it does not. For the latter case (ii), we propose a novel framework with regularizations, which we demonstrate are sufficient for identifying domain-general feature representations without a priori knowledge (or proxies) of the spurious features.

We also introduce a flexible transformer-based model for general-purpose ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple video settings covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications.

Two significant challenges exist: the lack of an affordable and accessible teleoperation system suitable for a dual-arm setup with multifingered hands, and the scarcity of multifingered hand hardware equipped with touch sensing. To tackle the first challenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that leverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that enables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also supports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth policy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel hardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch sensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we learn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult to achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning.

Building upon this, recent studies, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, have proposed the use of prompt learning, where context within a prompt is replaced with learnable vectors, leading to significant improvements over manually crafted prompts. However, the performance improvement for unseen classes is still marginal, and to tackle this problem, data augmentation has been frequently used in traditional zero-shot learning techniques. Through our experiments, we have identified important issues in CoOp and CoCoOp: the context learned through traditional image augmentation is biased toward seen classes, negatively impacting generalization to unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose adversarial token embedding to disentangle low-level visual augmentation features from high-level class information when inducing bias in learnable prompts. Through our novel mechanism called ""Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning"", AAPL, we guide the learnable context to effectively extract text features by focusing on high-level features for unseen classes.

  Optimization","With the increasing computational costs associated with deep learning, automated hyperparameter optimization methods, strongly relying on black-box Bayesian optimization (BO), face limitations. Freeze-thaw BO offers a promising grey-box alternative, strategically allocating scarce resources incrementally to different configurations. However, the frequent surrogate model updates inherent to this approach pose challenges for existing methods, requiring retraining or fine-tuning their neural network surrogates online, introducing overhead, instability, and hyper-hyperparameters. In this work, we propose FT-PFN, a novel surrogate for Freeze-thaw style BO. FT-PFN is a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that leverages the transformers' in-context learning ability to efficiently and reliably do Bayesian learning curve extrapolation in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis across three benchmark suites shows that the predictions made by FT-PFN are more accurate and 10-100 times faster than those of the deep Gaussian process and deep ensemble surrogates used in previous work. Furthermore, we show that, when combined with our novel acquisition mechanism (MFPI-random), the resulting in-context freeze-thaw BO method (ifBO), yields new state-of-the-art performance in the same three families of deep learning HPO benchmarks considered in prior work.",2024-04-25

Suppose we have a moderately trained LLM (e.g., trained to align with human preference) in hand, can we further exploit its potential and cheaply acquire a stronger model? In this paper, we propose a simple method called ExPO to boost LLMs' alignment with human preference. ExPO assumes that a medium-aligned model can be interpolated between a less-aligned (weaker) model, e.g., the initial SFT model, and a better-aligned (stronger) one, thereby directly obtaining this stronger model by extrapolating from the weights of the former two relatively weaker models. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, we show that ExPO pushes models trained with less preference data (e.g., 10% or 20%) to reach and even surpass the fully-trained one, without any additional training. Furthermore, ExPO also significantly improves off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF models and exhibits decent scalability across model sizes from 7B to 70B. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of model extrapolation in exploiting LLMs' capabilities, suggesting a promising direction that deserves future exploration.",2024-04-25

By leveraging the stage structures of the task, DrS learns a high-quality dense reward from sparse rewards and demonstrations if given. The learned rewards can be \textit{reused} in unseen tasks, thus reducing the human effort for reward engineering. Extensive experiments on three physical robot manipulation task families with 1000+ task variants demonstrate that our learned rewards can be reused in unseen tasks, resulting in improved performance and sample efficiency of RL algorithms.

Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping) and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative rewards via a direct policy parameterization between two completions to a prompt, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally tractable than PPO.",2024-04-25

We propose to close this gap by designing an intuitive baseline for TKG Forecasting based on predicting recurring facts. Compared to most TKG models, it requires little hyperparameter tuning and no iterative training. Further, it can help to identify failure modes in existing approaches.

Here we formally characterize the notion of fairness for generative AI as a basis for monitoring and enforcing fairness. We define two levels of fairness utilizing the concept of infinite words. The first is the fairness demonstrated on the generated sequences, which is only evaluated on the outputs while agnostic to the prompts/models used. The second is the inherent fairness of the generative AI model, which requires that fairness be manifested when input prompts are neutral, that is, they do not explicitly instruct the generative AI to produce a particular type of output. We also study relative intersectional fairness to counteract the combinatorial explosion of fairness when considering multiple categories together with lazy fairness enforcement.

  Detection","Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques.   In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA.

We extensively experiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and with different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g. sequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead to hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling objective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct pruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language modeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint existence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization behaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear order). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover transformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a correlation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset and whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a hierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear generalization.",2024-04-25

Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from solely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies.

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go.

Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and visual input preprocessing on policy learning. Our results mark a promising step forward in bimanual multifingered manipulation from visuotactile data. Videos, code, and datasets can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/hato/ .",2024-04-25
1062,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16804v1,AAPL: Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models,"Recent advances in large pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on zero-shot downstream tasks. Building upon this, recent studies, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, have proposed the use of prompt learning, where context within a prompt is replaced with learnable vectors, leading to significant improvements over manually crafted prompts. However, the performance improvement for unseen classes is still marginal, and to tackle this problem, data augmentation has been frequently used in traditional zero-shot learning techniques. Through our experiments, we have identified important issues in CoOp and CoCoOp: the context learned through traditional image augmentation is biased toward seen classes, negatively impacting generalization to unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose adversarial token embedding to disentangle low-level visual augmentation features from high-level class information when inducing bias in learnable prompts. Through our novel mechanism called ""Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning"", AAPL, we guide the learnable context to effectively extract text features by focusing on high-level features for unseen classes. We have conducted experiments across 11 datasets, and overall, AAPL shows favorable performances compared to the existing methods in few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, cross-dataset, and domain generalization tasks.",2024-04-25

  Optimization","With the increasing computational costs associated with deep learning, automated hyperparameter optimization methods, strongly relying on black-box Bayesian optimization (BO), face limitations. Freeze-thaw BO offers a promising grey-box alternative, strategically allocating scarce resources incrementally to different configurations. However, the frequent surrogate model updates inherent to this approach pose challenges for existing methods, requiring retraining or fine-tuning their neural network surrogates online, introducing overhead, instability, and hyper-hyperparameters. In this work, we propose FT-PFN, a novel surrogate for Freeze-thaw style BO. FT-PFN is a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that leverages the transformers' in-context learning ability to efficiently and reliably do Bayesian learning curve extrapolation in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis across three benchmark suites shows that the predictions made by FT-PFN are more accurate and 10-100 times faster than those of the deep Gaussian process and deep ensemble surrogates used in previous work. Furthermore, we show that, when combined with our novel acquisition mechanism (MFPI-random), the resulting in-context freeze-thaw BO method (ifBO), yields new state-of-the-art performance in the same three families of deep learning HPO benchmarks considered in prior work.",2024-04-25

Suppose we have a moderately trained LLM (e.g., trained to align with human preference) in hand, can we further exploit its potential and cheaply acquire a stronger model? In this paper, we propose a simple method called ExPO to boost LLMs' alignment with human preference. ExPO assumes that a medium-aligned model can be interpolated between a less-aligned (weaker) model, e.g., the initial SFT model, and a better-aligned (stronger) one, thereby directly obtaining this stronger model by extrapolating from the weights of the former two relatively weaker models. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, we show that ExPO pushes models trained with less preference data (e.g., 10% or 20%) to reach and even surpass the fully-trained one, without any additional training. Furthermore, ExPO also significantly improves off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF models and exhibits decent scalability across model sizes from 7B to 70B. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of model extrapolation in exploiting LLMs' capabilities, suggesting a promising direction that deserves future exploration.",2024-04-25

In our work, we propose DrS (Dense reward learning from Stages), a novel approach for learning reusable dense rewards for multi-stage tasks in a data-driven manner. By leveraging the stage structures of the task, DrS learns a high-quality dense reward from sparse rewards and demonstrations if given. The learned rewards can be \textit{reused} in unseen tasks, thus reducing the human effort for reward engineering. Extensive experiments on three physical robot manipulation task families with 1000+ task variants demonstrate that our learned rewards can be reused in unseen tasks, resulting in improved performance and sample efficiency of RL algorithms. The learned rewards even achieve comparable performance to human-engineered rewards on some tasks. See our project page (https://sites.google.com/view/iclr24drs) for more details.",2024-04-25

Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping) and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative rewards via a direct policy parameterization between two completions to a prompt, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally tractable than PPO.",2024-04-25

To this day, standardized evaluation protocols and rigorous comparison across TKG models are available, but the importance of simple baselines is often neglected in the evaluation, which prevents researchers from discerning actual and fictitious progress. We propose to close this gap by designing an intuitive baseline for TKG Forecasting based on predicting recurring facts. Compared to most TKG models, it requires little hyperparameter tuning and no iterative training. Further, it can help to identify failure modes in existing approaches.

First, during training we apply layer dropout, with low dropout rates for earlier layers and higher dropout rates for later layers, and an early exit loss where all transformer layers share the same exit. Second, during inference, we show that this training recipe increases the accuracy of early exit at earlier layers, without adding any auxiliary layers or modules to the model. Third, we present a novel self-speculative decoding solution where we exit at early layers and verify and correct with remaining layers of the model. Our proposed self-speculative decoding approach has less memory footprint than other speculative decoding approaches and benefits from shared compute and activations of the draft and verification stages. We run experiments on different Llama model sizes on different types of training: pretraining from scratch, continual pretraining, finetuning on specific data domain, and finetuning on specific task. We implement our inference solution and show speedups of up to 2.16x on summarization for CNN/DM documents, 1.82x on coding, and 2.0x on TOPv2 semantic parsing task.",2024-04-25

Here we formally characterize the notion of fairness for generative AI as a basis for monitoring and enforcing fairness. We define two levels of fairness utilizing the concept of infinite words. The first is the fairness demonstrated on the generated sequences, which is only evaluated on the outputs while agnostic to the prompts/models used. The second is the inherent fairness of the generative AI model, which requires that fairness be manifested when input prompts are neutral, that is, they do not explicitly instruct the generative AI to produce a particular type of output. We also study relative intersectional fairness to counteract the combinatorial explosion of fairness when considering multiple categories together with lazy fairness enforcement. Our implemented specification monitoring and enforcement tool shows interesting results when tested against several generative AI models.",2024-04-25

To create a realistic benchmark, we develop B-MoCA based on the Android operating system and define 60 common daily tasks. Importantly, we incorporate a randomization feature that changes various aspects of mobile devices, including user interface layouts and language settings, to assess generalization performance. We benchmark diverse agents, including agents employing large language models (LLMs) or multi-modal LLMs as well as agents trained from scratch using human expert demonstrations.

  Detection","Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques.   In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels.

Yet, the progression of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM framework specifically developed for the medical domain.

Although many performance predictors correlate well with ground truth performance, they require training data in the form of trained networks. Recently, zero-cost proxies have been proposed as an efficient method to estimate network performance without any training. However, they are still poorly understood, exhibit biases with network properties, and their performance is limited. Inspired by the drawbacks of zero-cost proxies, we propose neural graph features (GRAF), simple to compute properties of architectural graphs.

We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality.

In this work, we outline the connection between quantum noise channels and differential privacy (DP), by constructing a family of noise channels which are inherently $\epsilon$-DP: $(\alpha, \gamma)$-channels. Through this approach, we successfully replicate the $\epsilon$-DP bounds observed for depolarizing and random rotation channels, thereby affirming the broad generality of our framework. Additionally, we use a semi-definite program to construct an optimally robust channel. In a small-scale experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of using our optimal noise channel over depolarizing noise, particularly in enhancing adversarial accuracy.

  Transformers Generalize Hierarchically","Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its hierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic structures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we investigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training that could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively experiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and with different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g. sequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead to hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling objective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct pruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language modeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint existence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization behaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear order). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover transformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a correlation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset and whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a hierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear generalization.",2024-04-25

Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from solely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G3AD can outperform seventeen state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",2024-04-25

The core concept of the DRSS method involves reformulating the DR covariate-shift problem as a weighted empirical risk minimization problem, where the weights are subject to uncertainty within a predetermined range. By extending the SS technique to accommodate this weight uncertainty, the DRSS method is capable of reliably identifying unnecessary samples and features under any future distribution within a specified range.

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go.
