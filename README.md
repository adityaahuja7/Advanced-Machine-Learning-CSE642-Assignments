# Result:
If you try to train simple MLP with two target,target_5 and target_10, it sticks to 72% in low_noise data, sticks to 58% in high noise.
if you try to train simple MLP with successive targets,target_5 and target_10 then low_noise=

# Era
- Normal MLP on No Noise, Low Noise & High Noise Datasets.
- Ensemble Classifier with duplicated model
- SubTab on Low Noise, High Noise

# target_10_val
- NAL Loss + SubTab on Low Noise, High Noise
-
